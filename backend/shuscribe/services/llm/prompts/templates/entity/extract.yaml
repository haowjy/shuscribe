  # Instructions
  - Extract and classify all significant narrative entities in this chapter

  ## Extraction Rules
  - Make sure to combine entities that reference the same entity (describe the entity in more detail if needed)
  - Include both explicitly named as well as strongly implied entities
  - Note uncertainty when entity details are ambiguous
  - Try to be selective about what entities you include -- only include entities that you believe are important to the story now and and could return to in the future
