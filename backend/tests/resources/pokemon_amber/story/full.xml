<Chapter title="[Chapter 1] Truck-kun Strikes Again" file="story/chapter1.txt">
'Fuck,' I thought, hunched over my phone in the fading afternoon light. My fingers hovered over the screen as if I could somehow intimidate the numbers into change.
My Gyarados—level 40, carefully trained, survivor of multiple gym battles and approximately eight thousand random Pidgey and Mankey encounters—was down to a sliver of health. Across the battlefield, a level 37 Vulpix stared back with pixels that somehow managed to look smug. It had probably practiced that look in the mirror.
I'd already lost two good Pokemon this past hour. My box was only down to shitty Pokemon. I couldn't lose another. Not now.
The Pokemon Mansion sprawled across my phone screen in all its 8-bit glory, a maze of broken tiles and forgotten experiments. Outside my dorm window, campus life continued its usual Sunday afternoon rhythm—distant voices, someone practicing guitar badly, and the occasional burst of laughter. None were aware I was one critical hit away from losing weeks of careful training.
Gyarados had been with me since Route 6. Just a Magikarp then, making the same old investment that everyone knows pays off—except this time, with perma-death rules, each level had felt like holding my breath underwater.
I could switch in Charizard—my starter, my ace—but the damn thing was already at the level cap. One more fight and it'd be benched until after Blaine. Kadabra might one-shot it with Psychic—if it didn't get bodied first. My Dugtrio was a speed stat with hit points at this point, and Nidoking was still fucked up from that double-battle ambush earlier. Then there was the Growlithe I'd caught an hour ago, but sending it in would be straight-up murder.
Five options. Five ways to lose a teammate. Five—
A Discord notification slid down from the top of my screen. My thumb twitched instinctively to swipe it away, but the message caught my eye before I could dismiss it.
```
BigDKarp: @everyone SHADOW MEWTWO RAID AT LIBRARY GYM
BigDKarp: @EVERYONE 10 MIN WINDOW GET HERE NOW
```
Curious, I tapped the notification to see what the fuss was all about.
```
[March 22, 2024]
RaidenMain2: Hey, anyone hear about the shadow mewtwo event?
ProfOaksFavStudent: starts next week right?
RaidenMain2: Does anyone want to head downtown for it?
MissingNo404: Down, what time does the event start?
[March 30, 2024]
BigDKarp: @everyone SHADOW MEWTWO RAID AT LIBRARY GYM
RaidenMain2: holy shit it's on campus?
BigDKarp: @EVERYONE 10 MIN WINDOW GET HERE NOW

BigDKarp: @everyone SHADOW MEWTWO AT LIBRARY
RaidenMain2: @everyone LETS GOOOOO
BigDKarp: TEN MINS LEFT
ProfOaksFavStudent: @AlexaTheGreat where u at? we need ur Darkrai
```
I briefly swiped back to the emulator, hesitating over my next move before quickly tapping the menu and saving my state.
'I’ll deal with this later,' I decided. Shadow Mewtwo just sounded too cool and the battle wasn’t going anywhere. The early spring air bit at my face as I burst from the dorm building, nearly colliding with a cluster of freshmen who hadn't learned that campus sidewalks have their own unwritten rules of navigation.
The library stood sentinel across University Avenue. The crosswalk's red hand blinked its warning—a traffic signal I'd normally respect. But the street stretched empty in both directions.
My phone buzzed again.
```
RaidenMain2: @AlexaTheGreat where u at??
BigDKarp: 2 min until the raid @everyone HURRY IF YOU WANT SHADOW MEWTWO
```
My phone's screen painted my face in blue light as I jogged, the little avatar shuffling across a simplified version of my world—one minute forty-five seconds. The library's Pokestop spun with casual indifference, promising digital treasures that suddenly seemed far less important as a deep mechanical groan vibrated through my bones.
A shadow fell across my phone. I looked up—too late, too slow—as steel and chrome filled my vision. Physics asserted itself with elegant simplicity: mass plus velocity equals the end of all your carefully laid plans.
My last thoughts weren't deep or meaningful. Nothing about family, nothing about wasted potential, not even the cosmic irony of dying for a mobile game. Instead, I thought about my Gyarados, frozen in time with that sliver of health, waiting for a command that would never come.
Then darkness. Not the dramatic fade-to-black of movies or the peaceful drift of sleep, but a sudden cessation of input, like someone yanked the cartridge out mid-game.
-[v.v]-
The darkness didn't last.
Awareness returned in fragments, each sensation filtered through amber fluid that pressed against me like thick honey. The world beyond my container was a blur of orange-tinted shadows. I floated, suspended in something that felt thicker than water, almost syrupy against my skin. My lungs should have been burning, demanding air, but they felt eerily still, as if my body had forgotten it needed to breathe.
Sound reached me in waves, distorted and strange. Everything felt muffled except for the deep vibrations that traveled through the fluid itself, pressing against skin that felt too new, too small, like clothes that had shrunk in the wash. A tremor rippled through my container, and another, each one stronger than the last. Then came a sound that defied description—something between a roar and a thought-given voice, so deep it seemed to resonate in bones I wasn't sure were mine anymore.
When the container finally gave way, it wasn't gradual. Hairline fractures spiderwebbed across my visible world, transforming the emergency lights into kaleidoscopic fragments. The final crack came sharp and decisive, and suddenly the world was cold air and gravity and sensation that felt too sharp, too real.
Strong arms caught me before I could fall—arms that seemed impossibly large, attached to a middle-aged man whose tear-streaked face loomed above me. Everything was wrong, scaled up as if I'd somehow shrunk in my moment of unconsciousness. I went to return his embrace instinctively, the way you do when someone is crying and holding you, but the arms that responded to my commands weren't mine. These were delicate things. Pale. Small. Unblemished. Just… wrong.
"Amber," the giant middle-aged man choked out, his voice thick with emotion. "You're alive. You're really alive."
He pulled back just enough to shrug off his lab coat with shaking hands, wrapping it around my shoulders with gentle urgency. The fabric draped over me like a tent, still warm from his body and carrying a mix of scents—antiseptic, coffee, and something earthy that spoke of long hours in this underground lab. The simple act of covering me seemed to steady him somehow, as if the familiar motion of caring for a child helped anchor him in this impossible moment.
My attempt at speech emerged as a quiet "Who...?" and even that single word felt like a betrayal. The voice wasn't mine—too high, too young, distinctly feminine in ways that sent fresh waves of confusion through my already overwhelmed mind.
The tears falling on my face mixed with residual amber fluid, creating trails of warmth that felt impossibly intimate. The man held me like something precious, something miraculous, and through the blur of liquid and tears, I studied his face. There was something familiar there, something I should recognize, but understanding stayed just out of reach.
In my peripheral vision, something caught my eye.
A tail. Purple and massive, sweeping through broken equipment with casual, elegant destruction. Trails of violet energy hung in the air behind it, making the world look unstable, and unfinished. And there, suspended in the chaos of its own liberation, was Mewtwo. Not the 8-bit sprite or 3d render of the modern games, but something raw and primal and terrifyingly real. Its form rippled with power that hadn't quite settled into being, each movement carrying the weight of something that existed outside the natural order.
Our eyes met, and primal terror froze me in place. Every Pokemon instinct screamed that eye contact meant a battle was about to start—but reality had its own cruel humor. No menu would slide into view, no convenient mechanics would save me. Just raw existence: me in this too-small body that felt like borrowed clothing, facing down a creature that had transcended from pixels to godhood without bothering to include a user manual.
Time stretched between us, neither moving, neither breathing. Something flickered in those violet eyes—recognition? Memory?—before reality came crashing back in the form of a torrent of flames that caught Mewtwo in its side. The legendary Pokemon tumbled through the air, its psychic shield materializing like heat shimmer before steadying.
The moment shattered, and pure survival instinct took over.
"We have to go!" My borrowed voice cracked with urgency as I tugged at the giant man's lab coat. The pieces suddenly clicked into place like a puzzle I hadn't known I was solving—the liquid tank, the legendary Pokémon wreaking havoc above us, this man's tears of joy. This wasn't just any scientist, and I wasn't in just any facility. The reality of my situation hit me with the force of a truck: I was standing in front of Dr. Fuji himself, wearing his dead daughter's form, while the most powerful Pokémon ever created battled it out.
Dr. Fuji nodded and wiped his tears, though he kept staring at me with a hint of disbelief.
He scooped me up without hesitation, and suddenly the world viewed from his height made everything more alien. The laboratory was in chaos—emergency lights cutting red swaths through steam clouds, while sparks rained from destroyed equipment like artificial stars. The air itself felt wrong, charged with an electric tension that made my skin prickle and my hair stand on end.
Through the mayhem, I caught glimpses of other tanks like mine, now reduced to modern art installations of shattered glass and spilled amber fluid. A security guard's Arcanine launched another stream of flames, catching Mewtwo mid-hover. For all its legendary status, basic physics still applied—the impact slammed it into reinforced concrete hard enough to crack both. Pain flashed across its features, quickly transforming into something darker, something that promised retribution.
For a moment, I thought we were about to witness exactly why the games classified it as being the world’s strongest pokemon. But instead, it glanced between the Arcanine, the damaged wall, and—briefly—at me.
Then, with a pulse of psychic energy that shattered every remaining bit of glass in the room, it blasted upward through the ceiling. Moonlight poured in through the new skylight, illuminating the destruction below. Dr. Fuji's arms tightened around me with sudden urgency, pulling me against his chest and tucking my head under his chin. The world compressed to darkness, heartbeats, and the smell of the amber fluid still clinging to his lab coat.
Sound painted the picture I couldn't see—the thunderous cascade of falling concrete, the crystalline symphony of shattering glass, something that might have been a support beam groaning its way to failure. Through it all, Dr. Fuji's arms remained steady, though I could feel tremors running through him each time something heavy struck nearby.
When the crashes finally faded to scattered plinks and the occasional distant rumble, Dr. Fuji's grip loosened. I pulled back, blinking in the strange new light. Moonlight streamed through a jagged hole that had once been a ceiling, painting silver highlights on broken equipment and scattered research.
Across the room, reality had stopped trying to make sense. Alarms wailed in competing frequencies—high-pitched containment breach warnings mixing with the deeper drone of structural failure alerts, creating a discordant symphony that made my teeth ache. Through the cacophony, I watched a partially-formed Kadabra variant suddenly glitch into the half-destroyed lab, its too-many-fingers leaving trails of psychic energy in the air, before disappearing again.
A pained grunt drew my attention back to Dr. Fuji. He was hunched forward now, one hand pressed against the wall for support while the other still tried to keep me steady. His clothes had been shredded across the back, and through the tears, I could see angry red welts already darkening to bruises where chunks of ceiling had struck. A particularly nasty gash along his shoulder blade was slowly painting his clothes crimson.
"A-Are you alright?" The question slipped out in my new voice, high and clear and caring in a way that surprised me.
Dr. Fuji's grunt of pain pulled me back from my daze. He was already reaching for me again, his arms trembling slightly but determined. Despite the chaos—or perhaps because of it—his focus remained entirely on me as if the legendary Pokémon wreaking havoc above us was merely an inconvenience.
We picked our way across what remained of the laboratory floor, my bare feet finding surprising purchase on debris-scattered tiles. The reinforced door hung askew on its hinges, blown outward by Mewtwo's psychic blast. Beyond it, the scene transformed with jarring suddenness—no more clinical white walls or exposed machinery, just the refined interior of what could have been any wealthy estate. Wood paneling replaced sterile steel and ornate light fixtures cast shadows where monitoring equipment should have been.
The hallway held a handful of scientists in various states of panic, their lab coats looking strangely out of place against the mansion's carefully curated aesthetic. Two security guards tried maintaining order while radioing for backup, their professional demeanor cracking under the weight of what they'd just witnessed. Through a doorway, someone hurriedly disconnected a hard drive, hands shaking as they worked. Fragments of conversation floated above the chaos...
"...security breach in the east wing, we need..."
"...containment field's down in Enhancement Lab Three..."
“...Fuji’s legendary clone…”
"...the evolution acceleration chamber is overloading..."
The facility's emergency lighting painted everything in harsh red pulses as we made our way through the corridors, but now real flames were beginning to join the artificial warning lights. Smoke curled along the ceiling in lazy ribbons, and I could feel the temperature rising with each step. The lab coat around my shoulders felt less comforting now, its fabric growing warm from more than just body heat. I couldn't stop staring at Dr. Fuji's back, watching crimson slowly seep through his clothes while orange light from growing fires cast dancing shadows around us. Each step seemed to cost him, though he never loosened his grip on my hand.
"Everything will be different now," Dr. Fuji said softly, his voice barely carrying over the crackle of flames behind us. Orange light painted the treeline in false sunset, while smoke curled through branches. "We can fix it all—our family, our life. Everything."

<Chapter title="[Chapter 2] All Aboard!" file="story/chapter2.txt">
Sleep wasn't just elusive—it felt dangerous. Each time exhaustion started to drag me under, some part of my brain would jolt awake, terrified that closing these eyes meant losing whatever thread still connected me to myself.
The hotel room's ceiling fan spun lazy circles, each rotation collecting shadows that looked too much like the fractals of psychic energy I'd seen during Mewtwo's awakening. That had been real. All of it had been real. The clone tank's fluid still burned in borrowed lungs whenever I breathed too deeply, a sharp chemical taste that belonged in sci-fi stories, not reality. Not supposed to be my reality.
I caught another glimpse of mint-green hair on the dark TV screen and had to look away. Ten years old. I was ten years old again, or at least this body was. The wrongness of it sat like lead in my stomach—adult thoughts trapped in a child's form, muscle memory that belonged to someone else entirely. Even my fingerprints felt foreign when I ran them across the scratchy hotel blanket; too small, too smooth, too new.
Through the darkness, I could hear Dr. Fuji's steady breathing from the other bed. The sound made my chest ache. 
He'd moved heaven, earth, and even created the most powerful Pokemon to bring his daughter back.
And for what? For someone stupid enough to run out in front of a truck?
I was an accident of consciousness in a form that should have failed, never supposed to have lived.
Each breath felt stolen. Each heartbeat was a reminder that somewhere in this world, there was a grave with Amber's name on it, marking where this body's original owner rested while I played at being alive in her place.
Laughter drifted through the walls from other rooms—probably tourists enjoying their island getaway, planning tomorrow's outings to the volcano or the beach. 
How many people visited this island, never knowing about the laboratory hidden beneath their feet? About the clone tanks and the failed experiments and the most powerful Pokemon in existence now tasting its first breath of freedom?
The volcano's silhouette loomed beyond the window, a darker shadow against the night sky. Somewhere out there, Mewtwo was grappling with its own existence, another consciousness that never should have been. But at least it had been made with a purpose—to be the most powerful Pokémon in existence. I was just... an accident. A consciousness that slipped through some crack in reality into a form that should have failed.
Memories of my old life flashed before my eyes like someone else's home videos—crystal clear but impossibly distant. Mom's patient smile as I explained why this new Pokemon game was different from the last six. That lazy orange tabby who'd earned his Snorlax nickname. The thrill of finally pulling that Charizard VMAX during lockdown, when Pokemon cards became an escape from endless Zoom lectures. That last, stupid battle—Tsunami the Gyarados getting crit twice in the mansion right before...
I pressed my palms against my eyes until stars burst behind them. Even that sensation felt wrong—the pressure, the size of my hands, the way the joints bent. Everything was off by degrees so small they shouldn't matter but somehow added up to a symphony of wrongness that made me want to crawl out of this skin.
And beneath all of it, a deeper terror lurked: Team Rocket. They'd lost their prize weapon and their secret lab, but they hadn't lost their reach. 
The future splintered in my head—competing versions of what could come next. In the anime, they'd eventually capture and control Mewtwo, bending its will to Giovanni's ambitions until it finally escaped. In the games, it would flee to Cerulean Cave, becoming a legend whispered about by trainers. The manga version seemed least likely—Blaine hadn't been involved in this creation. What did I mean for the plot?
Each version of the future felt equally possible now, equally real. How could I plan for all the different timelines? And more terrifyingly—what would Team Rocket do if they realized one of their failed experiments was walking around with a head full of meta knowledge? With an adult's understanding of their plans wrapped in a child's vulnerable form?
Through the window, Cinnabar's stars wheeled overhead, indifferent to the impossible thing breathing beneath them. Not a success, not a failure—something entirely new. Something no one, not even God… no, Arceus, himself, had planned for. And tomorrow... tomorrow I'd have to wake up and keep pretending. Keep breathing. Keep existing in a form that wasn't mine while carrying memories that didn't belong here.
The fan spun on, its shadows still dancing like psychic fractals, each rotation seeming to ask: who are you really? The person who died chasing a mobile game, or the experiment who stole a second chance? 
\[v.v]/
The beach slowly filled with passengers, fifteen others in total—a couple of families clutching travel bags, a businessman in a suit that probably cost more than a starter Pokemon, and two trainers who looked like they'd stepped out of a contest poster. I stifled another yawn, wiggling my toes in shoes that still felt new. The volcanic sand was oddly warm even this early, with black crystals skating across the beach with each gust of wind.
The businessman checked his watch for the third time in five minutes. One of the kids had fallen asleep against her mother's leg. The contest trainers had given up on looking cool and were now sitting cross-legged in the sand, sharing what looked like a breakfast pastry.
Suddenly, the air... shifted. Like the moment before a storm breaks, when everything goes still and electric.
Then I heard it.
A whistle cut through the dawn—three sharp notes that made everyone freeze. The sound of wings came next, starting as a whisper and building to a rush that seemed to push the very mist aside.
They emerged from the dawn like something out of a dream—eight massive shapes descending in perfect formation. Four Pidgeots on each side, their wingspans casting moving shadows across the beach. A Fearow cut through the morning light on one flank, all sharp edges and deadly grace, while a Noctowl glided silently on the other.
Holy shit.
Holy actual shit.
Those were Pidgeot. Eight real, breathing, absolutely massive Pidgeot, arranged in a perfect V with a Fearow and Noctowl flanking them like feathered fighter escorts. They descended with practiced precision, and I found myself counting pixels that weren't there because some part of my mind was still trying to process this like a game sprite or cartoon. But there was nothing pixelated about them.
I'd had this dream before—every kid with a Gameboy or TV had. But dreams didn't come with the smell of sea salt and feathers, didn't include the way morning light caught their crests and turned them into living flame. My hands were shaking. These weren't just Pokemon—they were POKEMON. Actually real, actually here, close enough to touch if I wasn't frozen in place trying to remember how breathing worked.
The closest Pidgeot turned its head, preening a feather back into place with the casual grace of something that could probably break the sound barrier before breakfast. When the formerly-sleeping kid stumbled forward, it tilted its head with bird-like curiosity. Just a big, well-trained flying type going about its morning routine. Completely normal. Totally ordinary. Just a Pidgeot, doing Pidgeot things, while my internal monologue alternated between incoherent screaming and 'don't cry don't cry don't cry.'
The trainers landed behind their Pokemon, boots crunching on volcanic sand. The woman moved with the easy grace of someone who'd learned to walk on wind, her flight jacket a patchwork of badges I didn't recognize. Her Ampharos prowled between the Pidgeot, tail held high like an airport marshal's wand. The man was all business, his weathered face creased in permanent concentration as his Magneton hovered nearby.
"Morning folks!" The woman's voice carried easily over the sound of wings settling. "I'm Captain Lin, that's Captain Reed. We'll be your scenic tour to Celadon today." She grinned at the businessman's barely concealed wince at the word 'scenic.' "Don't worry—we'll have you there in time for your meetings. Now, let's get you all sorted."
The division happened with practiced efficiency: three sets of passengers and their bags for each group of four Pidgeot, carefully distributed for balance. Lin's Noctowl watched from the side with ancient eyes that seemed to measure each soul that passed, while Reed's Fearow stalked the perimeter like a feathered drill sergeant.
I pressed my nails into my palms, using the small pain to ground myself. This was happening. This was real. In about ten minutes, I was going to fly on an actual Pidgeot.
Lin appeared beside me, her Ampharos’s static making my new hair float slightly. "First time?" she asked, grinning at whatever expression was on my face. "Don't worry—Storm here is gentle as they come." She patted the nearest Pidgeot, whose feathers rippled like silk in the morning light. "Though you might want to take a breath—you're starting to look a bit blue."
Right. Breathing. That was a thing I should probably keep doing.
The safety briefing washed over me in a blur of buckles and emergency procedures. Lin moved between passengers with the casual grace of someone who'd done this a thousand times, her Ampharos trailing behind like an anxious flight attendant, occasionally pushing bags up that weren't properly secured.
"Remember," she called out, "you're riding a Pokemon, not a train. They respond to tension. Relax, and they'll relax." Her Noctowl punctuated this with a soft hoot that somehow managed to sound both wise and slightly judgy.
The first step onto Storm's back felt like breaking some unspoken rule of the universe. Feathers shifted beneath my fingers, warm and alive and impossibly strong. I'd spent countless hours flying on Pidgeot in games, but nothing had prepared me for the reality of settling between wings that could split clouds.
"Knees soft," Lin advised, appearing beside me to check the straps. "And try not to grab feathers if you get nervous—Storm's understanding, but nobody likes having their hair pulled." Her Ampharos demonstrated proper handle-holding with exaggerated care, then scampered back to its special harness near Lin's position.
Dr. Fuji settled behind me, his presence both steadying and strange. The businessman ended up with a lovey dovy couple on the Pidgeot next to us. The couple flirted constantly while the businessman looked like he wanted to kill himself.
"Clear skies ahead!" Lin's voice carried over the morning breeze. Her Noctowl lifted off first, silent as a shadow, while Reed's Fearow took point with a cry that scattered sleeping Wingull from the nearby rocks. "Celadon Express is ready for departure!"
The takeoff stole my breath, my heart, and possibly several years off my new life. One moment we were earthbound, the next—glory. Storm's wings spread like sails of light, each downbeat a thunderclap of power. The beach fell away, black sand scattering in our wake, and my stomach did something that probably violated several laws of physics.
We climbed through layers of dawn, each wingbeat carrying us higher until the ocean spread out like a mirror below. The sun painted everything in impossible colors—rose gold and amber and colors I didn't have names for. Lin's group formed up on the right, Reed's on the left, their Pidgeot moving with the kind of precision that made my gaming brain want to count frames that didn't exist.
Ampharos’s head-bead sparked occasionally, tiny arcs of electricity dancing between it and Magneton’s magnets. The morning air grew thin and cold, but somehow a bubble of warmth surrounded us.
Somewhere between one heartbeat and the next, exhaustion finally caught up. The steady rhythm of Storm's wings, the salt-sweet wind, the gentle rise and fall of flight—it was a lullaby written in motion. My head nodded forward, then back, then forward again.
"Sleep if you need to," Lin called back, her voice carrying easily despite the wind. "Storm's got you."
I tried to protest. Tried to explain that sleep was for people who weren't living through every childhood dream at once. But my body—this new, strange, body—had other ideas. The last thing I remember was Dr. Fuji adjusting my straps, making sure I couldn't slip. Storm's feathers were softer than any pillow, and the wind sang stories of freedom in a language I was finally learning to understand.
I slept without dreams. Just the wind, the waves far below, and the steady heartbeat of a Pokemon carrying me toward whatever waited ahead.
</Chapter>

<Chapter title="[Chapter 3] All Aboard!" file="story/chapter3.txt">
"What do you mean you don’t want to wear a dress? You love dresses," Dr. Fuji had said three mornings ago, his voice gentle but brooking no argument as he'd laid out the powder-blue monstrosity. The words hung between us like a wall, trapping the truth behind teeth that didn't feel like mine. How could I explain that his daughter's preferences hadn't transferred along with her DNA?
Now, I stood before a mirror, tugging uselessly at another one of Dr. Fuji's stupid doll dresses. I glanced up at the mirror, seeing a deep frown etched on the girl’s face. Her mint-green hair caught light at impossible angles and her dark green eyes held a wariness that didn't belong on a child's face. Five days in this new world, and I still couldn't reconcile the image before me with my sense of self.
I caught Ditto watching me from its perch on the dresser, its amorphous form somehow managing to convey both attention and amusement. "You try wearing this," I muttered, tugging at the dress's hem for the hundredth time. The words had barely left my mouth when Ditto's body rippled with interest. It oozed down from the dresser like spilled honey, its mass pooling briefly on the floor before surging upward.
The transformation caught me off-guard—pink substance flowing, reshaping, solidifying into... into...
"Oh," I breathed, turning to face my duplicate. Ditto's version of me stood with perfect posture, making my own awkward stance feel even more obvious. Every detail was uncomfortably accurate, from the mint-green hair color to the power-blue dress.
"You know," I said, glancing between us, "If we're going to be stuck here, you could at least transform into something more practical. Even the girls in these kid's cartoons Dr. Fuji left for us are wearing pants!”
The copied version of me tilted its head in confusion.
"No, look," I said, turning to point at the ancient TV where a trainer in sensible hiking gear was scaling a mountain. "See? Pants. The bottom half." I gestured emphatically at the cartoon character's legs, then at my own dress-confined ones. "You know, for walking? Adventure? Not feeling like a dress-up doll?"
Ditto-me tilted its head, brow furrowing in concentration. For a moment, nothing happened. Then the transformation began—but something was wrong. The top half remained a perfect copy of me, but below the waist, the dress melted away into flat, two-dimensional cartoon legs, complete with bold outlines and cel-shaded pants.
"That's not quite what I..." I started, but the words died in my throat as Ditto tried to take a step. The cartoonish legs, utterly unsuited for three-dimensional movement, immediately gave out. My doppelganger collapsed in a heap, the realistic upper half merging with the animated lower half into a puddle of confused purple goo.
A laugh escaped me as I watched the purple mass reform into its natural purple blob shape with a (~_~) face, feeling an unexpected wave of affection for my shapeshifting companion. 
I couldn't help but marvel at the difference between its current actions and just three days ago.
Three days ago, Dr. Fuji gave Ditto clear instructions: "Protect her."
Back then, it had been all business—maintaining a careful distance, transforming only when commanded, watching me from corners with an unreadable expression. But yesterday, I'd caught it mimicking my movements in the mirror when it thought I wasn't looking, practicing expressions with an almost childlike curiosity before morphing back to neutrality the moment our eyes met. And now here it was, sprawled dramatically on my floor after its enthusiastically misguided attempt at cartoon fashion.
I shook my head with a smile underneath as I focused on my only other source of entertainment. 
I flopped onto the worn couch, its familiar softness reminding me of lazy weekend afternoons from another life.
"Let's see…” I muttered, clicking through channels. The TV itself was ancient by my standards—all curved screen and rabbit-ear antenna—but it worked well enough to pick up local broadcasts. A few clicks through static-filled channels finally landed on what looked like a local news broadcast. The production value wasn't much better than the static—the anchor's desk looked like it was made of painted plywood, and the graphics had that distinctly late-90s PowerPoint feel.
"...and in downtown Celadon, business owners are raising concerns about increasing Grimer populations in the sewage system," the anchor was saying, her heavily hairsprayed style completing the retro aesthetic. "Our field reporter is live at the scene."
Each channel brought another reminder that this wasn't just a world with Pokemon—it was a world built around them, shaped by their presence in ways both mundane and extraordinary. My thumb froze on the remote as familiar battle stadium architecture filled the screen. Two trainers faced each other across a regulation field, their Pokemon launching attacks that the cameras struggled to track.
The battle itself was both familiar and jarringly different from what I remembered. No health bars floated above the Pokemon's heads, no convenient status indicators blinked warnings. Instead, a Sandslash and Poliwrath clashed in a blur of motion that the dated camera technology struggled to capture, leaving ghostly afterimages on the curved screen.
The commentators' excited chatter filled our small apartment: "...and Wright’s Sandslash shows remarkable agility, folks! But wait- oh! Poliwrath's Water Gun catches it mid-roll!"
I leaned forward, unconsciously mimicking the tensed posture I'd held during countless gaming sessions. But this wasn't a matter of pressing the right buttons at the right time. The Sandslash's trainer shouted something lost in the crowd's roar, and her Pokemon responded with a desperate burrow into the arena floor—a move that would have taken two turns in the games but happened here in one fluid motion.
"Did you ever imagine battles would be like this?" I asked Ditto, who had inched closer to the screen, its amorphous form rippling with each impact shown. "No turn-based combat, no convenient pauses to think through strategy. Just…”
I paused as Ditto tilted its head in confusion.
A wry smile formed on my lips as I smacked my head. “Of course, this would be the normal here.”
I refocused my attention on the TV.
The Poliwrath's trainer, a weathered man who looked nothing like the pixel-perfect gym leaders I remembered, was already calling out his next command. His Pokemon's Water Gun carved channels in the arena floor, forcing the Sandslash to surface or drown. The camera zoomed in on the ground type's emergence, catching the moment its claws broke through the earth at an unexpected angle, spraying sand into its opponent's eyes.
Ditto made a sound that might have been appreciation, transforming briefly into a miniature version of the Sandslash before melting back to its natural state, as if testing how that movement would feel.
The broadcast cut to what passed for a post-match analysis—two men wedged behind a desk overlooking the battlefield wearing huge headsets and speaking into a massive black speaker like an old sports commentary broadcast.
I found myself nodding along to their commentary, memories of countless battle showdown simulators suddenly cast in a new light. 
I'd never been a sports person in my old life—couldn't have cared less about football stats or basketball plays. But this was different. This was Pokemon battling—real Pokemon battling, not the simplified turn-based system I'd known from games. 
My legs started swinging, the toes of my feet barely scraping the ground, heels drumming a restless beat against the couch base. The worn fabric that had felt so comfortably familiar minutes ago now pressed awkwardly against the backs of my knees, a constant reminder that this body was sized all wrong for casual lounging.
I tried tucking my legs under me instead, but that just made the couch feel deeper, like sitting in an oversized dollhouse. Even as my eyes stayed locked on the battle channel, this body hummed with a restless energy I'd never known in my previous life.
With a sigh, I slid off the couch, leaving the 2 men’s battle analysis playing in the background. The feeling was familiar by now—this wild, electric restlessness that seemed to buzz through Amber's limbs.
I got on my back and started to do sit-ups. Ditto, familiar with this particular ritual by now, flowed across the carpet to assume a beside me.
"One... two..." I counted out loud. Ditto bobbed up and down, as if it were copying my movements.
I briefly paused my set to laugh. Did Ditto even have muscle to train?
I quickly continued, attempting to exhaust all my tireless energy "Seventeen... eighteen..."
25 sit-ups. 10 push-ups. 25 squats. And a 0 km run. My body hummed with energy even after completing more exercise than I'd managed in any given week of my previous life.
I caught my reflection on the black TV screen during a transition and had to laugh at the absurdity of it all. Here I was, wearing a frilly dress that belonged in a Victorian dollhouse, performing calisthenics.
After 1 round to failure, I went again. And again. Until I had tapped out at 100 sit-ups. 20 push-ups. 100 squats. And a 0 km run. Collapsed to the ground. Everywhere felt sore, especially my jelly-like arms. I still had a long way to go to achieve baldness.
As I lay spread-eagled on the floor, I turned my head to look at Ditto, who had collapsed beside me with a slightly woozy (~.~), though its lack of actual exhaustion somehow made the gesture more endearing. 
Three days. Three days of watching battles I couldn't participate in, learning about a world I couldn't explore, sitting in an apartment that felt more like a gilded cage with each passing hour. If it were me in my past life, that would’ve been the perfect life.
I rolled onto my side and supported my head with my arm. I watched Ditto appear to doze off. I guess that really did tire it out. 
A plan that had been forming in my mind all morning suddenly crystallized.
"Hey Ditto," I said, pushing myself up on one elbow despite my protesting muscles, "can you keep a secret?"
Ditto straightened its form, instantly recovering from its “fatigue,” and tilted its head.
\[^.^]/
A few days later, I watched from behind a curtain as Dr. Fuji hurried down the street, his white lab coat catching the morning light like a beacon. Fifteen minutes crept by as I counted his steps, then another five to be absolutely certain. Only then did I dare to move.
The ancient backpack—a relic of Amber's past life—sat awkwardly on my shoulders, its straps adjusted as tight as they would go. Inside was food for me and Ditto and a spare set of keys. Not exactly survival gear, but it would have to do. The shiny black patent leather shoes were already starting to pinch.
"Wait," I murmured to Ditto, holding out its Pokeball. "I don't even know the rules about Pokemon in the city. Better stay in the ball until we're clear, okay?" It dissolved into red light without protest, though I could have sworn it rolled its eyes first. For all I knew, there could be restrictions about unleashed Pokemon, or licenses needed, or who knows what else.
The apartment door seemed impossibly loud as I eased it open, each creak a thunderous betrayal of my escape attempt. Down four flights of stairs on tiptoes, my shoes barely touching each step. At the building's entrance, I paused, heart thundering against my ribs like a trapped Pidgey.
I reached up on my tiptoes and opened the door to my real first steps into Celadon City.
The morning streets made my earlier caution feel absurd. Pokemon were everywhere, woven into the fabric of city life as naturally as pigeons in my old world—a Meowth sprawled across a windowsill like a furry king surveying its domain, Pidgey squabbling over something shiny in the gutters, even a Growlithe padding importantly beside a police officer, its badge-shaped collar catching the sun.
My fingers relaxed around Ditto's minimized ball, feeling sheepish. Red light flashed as I released it, and Ditto materialized with what I swore was an expression of mild amusement. Without prompting, it flowed up my arm and settled across my shoulders like a living scarf, its weight oddly comforting against my neck.
A real Pokemon city sprawled before me. Where my mind expected neat gridlines of pixels and predictable paths, Real Celadon flowed with organic chaos. Streets twisted between buildings that defied the simple up-down geography of the games, their shadows painting patterns that no sprite artist could have conceived.
The morning traffic moved with its own peculiar rhythm. Bicycles dominated the streets, weaving between the occasional car that crawled along like a rare and cautious beast. A pair of Machoke guided a floating platform of construction materials through the air with the casual confidence of everyday laborers, while a Pidgey postal service worker soared overhead, mailbag strapped securely to its chest. The sidewalks bustled with commuters, many with partner Pokemon trotting beside them or perched on shoulders—though none quite as blobby as my own 'scarf.'
I made my way to what looked like a transit stop—a narrow concrete building standing alone on its small plot, supported by thick columns that lifted the train tracks overhead. Steep metal stairs zigzagged up one side, their railings worn smooth from countless hands.
Inside, a row of ticket booths and turnstiles stretched along one wall. A machop, meowth, and human staffed the booths—the Machop’s stubby fingers surprising deft at handling coins while the Meowth’s whiskers twitched at every clink of currency.
But what caught my attention was the city map mounted between the booths and turnstiles. The bottom half was just low enough for me to study properly.
I traced routes with a finger, trying to ignore the small, but steady stream of commuters flowing around me. Unlike the neat grid of the games, real Celadon sprawled in every direction, districts bleeding into each other in normal, city-like ways.
I found 2 of the major landmarks of Celadon fairly easily.
The Gym was clearly marked and not that far from here. The Game Corner on the other hand looked to be at least 20 blocks away.
I had to step back and squint my eyes to find the Department Store and Game Corner somewhere further north. 
I glanced back at the toll booths and sighed—should have thought about the money problem as well. I definitely needed money to get there.
I closely examined the route I had to take before marching out of the building to start my first Pokemon adventure. Perhaps I’d earn my first gym badge out of it.
Onwards to the Celadon Gym!
</Chapter>

<Chapter title="[Chapter 4] Achievement Unlocked! First Battle!" file="story/chapter4.txt">
I found myself at the edge of a sprawling park, staring at a wooden sign that pointed toward "Celadon Gym Outer Gardens." Ditto shifted against my neck, its weight familiar now after our morning's city walk.
The gardens spread out before us, though they looked more like a public park than an actual garden. A patchwork of dirt and grass stretched across the grounds, with morning light catching the dew that still clung to the few spots untrampled by feet and attacks.
A battle between two young trainers caught my attention—a Doduo facing off against a Bellsprout on worn dirt. The Doduo actually had a clear advantage whenever it attacked—its attacks super effective when they connected—but its heads seemed more interested in arguing with each other than listening to commands. 
Its trainer shouted "Focus!" which, ironically, only made both heads turn to stare at him instead of dodging the incoming Vine Whip.
The Doduo trainer seemed ready to tear his hair out.
I settled against a tree trunk, oddly captivated. Ditto's weight shifted, stretching slightly as if also trying to get a better view. The battle meandered on, punctuated by moments of accidental competence—the Doduo managed a super effective peck, ending the battle and knocking out the Bellsprout.
The boy punched the air in victory while his opponent trudged over, counting out crumpled bills with the particular slowness of someone hoping the money might multiply if they took long enough.
I stood and found myself drifting between battles after that, unable to just glance and move on.
A Pidgey and Spearow whose battle climbed into the air. Two trainers coached their Pokemon through a practice match, stopping occasionally to discuss technique. An intense face-off between a Muk and a Poliwhirl that drew a small crowd.
The sun climbed higher and then began to fall. My stomach growled—and we briefly stopped for lunch. Ditto stayed quiet through it all, but I felt its subtle reactions—a slight tightening when attacks came too close, a gentle relaxation during the lulls between matches.
"Looking for a battle?"
The voice pulled me out of my battle-watching trance. A boy who couldn't have been more than ten years old stood before me, all elbows and knees and boundless confidence. His blue cap sat crooked on his head, and a Pokeball bounced between his hands with the kind of nervous energy that suggested he hadn't quite mastered the casual spinning trick he was attempting.
"Of course!" The words burst out the moment we locked eyes. It felt natural, automatic—like muscle memory from a thousand battles fought through pixels and button presses.
Ditto, who had been contentedly draped around my neck like a living scarf, perked up at my enthusiasm. Before I could second-guess myself, it had already slid down to the ground, bouncing slightly with an eagerness that made me wonder if it had been hoping for this.
The boy's face lit up. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a few coins. "Cool! Three hundred pokedollars?"
I flinched at the number before remembering that pokedollars were closer to yen than dollars—this was more like three bucks than three hundred. Still, I frowned as I instinctively reached for pockets where I would have had some change, but remembered I was wearing a dress when I just felt smooth fabric.
The boy's smile turned sharp at my hesitation. "Unless you're scaaaared?" He drew out the last word like stretching taffy, sweet with mockery. 
Fifteen years of Pokemon experience bristled at his tone. I'd bred perfect IVs, chained shinies, climbed to Master rank—and now a tiny kid... well, technically I was about the same age as him now, but that wasn't the point. I looked down at Ditto, who met my gaze with unwavering confidence.
This wasn't a game. I had no idea if Ditto's transformations worked the same way—if most stats and moves were copied. But, looking at its eager wobble, I felt something settle in my chest. Dr. Fuji had trusted this Ditto to guard his most precious creation, Ambertwo. If it was good enough for the scientist who created Mewtwo, it was good enough for a street battle.
'I've been playing Pokemon for longer than you’ve been alive' I thought, a familiar competitive spark igniting. ‘There’s no way I can lose to a brat like you.’
"Deal," I said, forcing steel into my voice. I only had to figure out the money situation if we lost.
"Sweet!" The boy backed up, creating space for our impromptu arena. A few nearby trainers paused their own activities, scenting the possibility of entertainment.
"Name's Joey," he called out, flicking his Pokeball open with a flourish that would have been impressive if he hadn't nearly dropped it. "Try not to cry when you lose!"
The ball flew up, a flash of red light materializing into a Rattata. "Rat-TAT!" It hissed with quiet ferocity.
I squared my shoulders, channeling confidence I didn't quite feel in a Ditto. "I could say the same to you."
Joey’s grin widened. Without warning, he thrust his arm forward. "Go! Rattata! Tackle!"
"What the—Hey! When did we start?" I shouted, watching Ditto barely slide to the side as Rattata barreled past. My heart hammered against my ribs—not from fear, but from indignation. No countdown, no proper start, just straight into attacks.
Joey’s grin turned smug. "You said you were ready, didn't you? Rattata! Keep going! Keep up the pressure!"
'Right,' I thought, watching Rattata wheel around for another pass. 'One of those people.' The kind who thought rules were for other people and basic courtesy was optional. The kind who'd cut in line at a coffee shop and then complain about the service. The kind who desperately needed someone to knock them down a peg or two, preferably in front of an audience.
"Ditto, dodge and transform!"
Ditto weaved away from another tackle, but instead of transforming, it turned its face toward me with an expression that could only be described as confusion. The sight was so unexpected that for a moment, I forgot we were in the middle of a battle.
"Ditto, transform!" I tried again, my voice climbing an octave higher than I'd have preferred. 
Joey's laughter cut through the air, sharp and mean in that particular way only pre-teens could manage. "Haha! A Pokemon that doesn't even know how to fight? What kind of weird blob did you catch? Rattata! Finish this loser up!"
"Ditto! Come on!" The words came out more desperate than I'd intended. "Transform into Rattata and fight back!"
And then—like that moment when you finally explain something the right way to someone who's been struggling—understanding flickered across Ditto's amorphous features. Its body shimmered, stretched, and suddenly there were two Rattata on the field. "Rat-TAT!" came Ditto's perfect mimicry of its opponent's cry.
Joey's mouth fell open, his previous bravado vanishing in an instant. "What the—What did—?" The words tumbled out in a shocked stutter. Even his Rattata took a step back, whiskers twitching in confusion.
I caught fragments of whispers from our impromptu audience: "Did you see—" "What kind of—" “I think I read about it in—”
I paused, the sudden attention prickling against my skin. A half-remembered theory floated through my mind—something about Ditto being failed clones of Mew—and I had to physically stop myself from slapping my forehead. Here I was, Clone-Amber, technically-daughter of the man who created Mewtwo, casually revealing what might be another of his classified experiments in a public park. If there was a guidebook for "How to Not Draw Attention to Your Secret Identity," I was probably breaking every chapter.
'Too late to worry about that now.' I turned back to face my opponent, who was staring at Ditto with the wide-eyed fascination of someone who'd just watched their understanding of Pokemon get turned inside out.
"Tail Whip!" I called out, immediately tense about my choice. It was pure muscle memory—fifteen years of Pokemon battles where status moves were the foundation of any decent strategy. In the games, it had been simple math: lower defense, increase damage output throughout the battle, victory. But now, watching Ditto face down a very real Rattata with very real teeth, I found myself questioning years of virtual combat experience. Would a tail swish actually make physical attacks hurt more here? Or had I just commanded my shapeshifting Pokemon to perform the equivalent of an intimidating dance move?
Ditto spun with a fluid grace that caught me off-guard. Joey’s Rattata tracked the motion, whiskers twitching rapidly, and when it settled back into its fighting stance, its movements carried a new hesitation.
'Huh,' I thought, watching the subtle shift in the Rattata's body language. 'So that's what a status move looks like in real life.'
"Ha!" Joey's voice cracked with false bravado. "Wasting time with fancy twirls? Rattata! Keep tackling! Full force! You can’t lose to a copy!"
"Perfect! Ditto, dodge and counter with Tackle!"
Ditto sidestepped the charging Rattata with the same fluid grace it had shown in its tail movement. It made me wonder if Dr. Fuji had spent some time combat-training it.
The original Rattata overextended, its eagerness working against it, and Ditto's counter-attack landed with precise timing. The impact sent Joey's Pokemon tumbling back, its previous confidence visibly shaken.
I felt my confidence growing. This wasn't just button inputs and damage calculations—Ditto wasn't just copying Rattata's form, it was moving with a precision that spoke of experience. Each dodge was efficient, each attack perfectly timed.
"Stop running away!" Joey's voice cracked. "Quick Attack! Don't let it dodge!"
His Rattata blurred forward—faster than eyes could track. Pure instinct made me shout, "Copy it! Meet it head-on!"
The collision came with a sharp crack. "RATTA!" Both Pokemon cried out in unison. Joey's Rattata went sprawling, while Ditto's form briefly rippled at the impact before stabilizing.
Joey's composure cracked entirely. "Keep attacking! Don't stop until you hit it!"
His Rattata launched into a frenzy of attacks, each wilder than the last. But Ditto moved like water, each dodge flowing into the next, letting Joey's Pokemon exhaust itself against empty air. It was the difference between button-mashing and actual technique—and Ditto had years of the latter programmed into whatever Dr. Fuji had done to it.
"Stop! Moving!" Joey's commands devolved into frustrated shouts, each one making his Rattata's attacks wilder. The poor Pokemon's movements were becoming ragged, each lunge leaving it more exposed than the last.
I watched the rhythm of their desperation, waiting. One particularly aggressive tackle left Joey's Rattata off-balance, its tail swinging wide to compensate. "Now, Ditto! Quick Attack!"
The counter was devastating in its simplicity—a clean strike that sent Joey's Rattata tumbling across the grass. When it struggled up, its legs trembled with exhaustion.
"Come on!" Joey's voice cracked. "You can't lose to some—some weird copy!"
I almost felt bad for them. Almost. "One more time, Ditto!"
The final Quick Attack landed with surgical precision. "Rat...ta..." Joey's Rattata slid to a stop at his feet, managed one defiant attempt to stand, and then collapsed with the classic swirls in its eyes that I'd only ever seen in the anime.
The scattered applause from our audience felt wrong somehow—too much attention for what was supposed to be a simple amateur battle. Probably because of Ditto.
Joey stared at his fallen Rattata for a long moment, his earlier swagger evaporating like morning dew. For a second, he looked exactly like what he was—a kid. Then his face scrunched up, bottom lip quivering dangerously.
'Oh no,' I thought, panic rising. I'd prepared for Pokemon battles and type matchups, but dealing with a crying child hadn't been part of any game guide I'd ever read.
But Joey surprised me. He took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and stepped forward. He dug into his pocket and pulled out the coins, holding them out with the stiff formality of someone trying very hard to pretend this didn't hurt.
"Fair's fair," he mumbled, gaze fixed somewhere around my left shoulder. "You won."
I stared at the coins, my earlier triumph mixing with an unexpected twinge of guilt. This wasn't some NPC handing over programmed currency—this was probably the kid's entire allowance. But... I was broke too.
"Thanks," I said quietly, accepting the money. "It was a good battle." The words felt a bit inadequate, but they were true enough.
I tucked the coins deep into my backpack, trying not to think too hard about winning my first real Pokemon currency through what basically amounted to hustling a kid. Joey had already trudged back to his rattata, nursing it with a potion. 
‘A good kid at heart,’ I thought as I watched him care for his fainted pokemon.
Ditto slithered back up to my neck, humming with what felt like both satisfaction and concern. "Nice work," I whispered, giving it a quick pat while scanning the dispersing crowd. Most had already turned away, but a few were still muttering among themselves, shooting curious glances in our direction.
</Chapter>

<Chapter title="[Chapter 5] A Perfectly Normal Gym Session" file="story/chapter4.txt">
The afternoon sun had begun its descent, casting shadows in the opposite direction through the ginkgo trees that lined the path ahead. Their fan-shaped leaves caught the light like tiny golden coins, creating a dappled pathway that seemed to lead straight to... my steps slowed as the actual gym building came into view.
The building ahead grew more imposing with each step, glass and steel rising up behind the ancient trees in a way that should have felt jarring but somehow worked. Like the games evolving from pixel art to modern graphics, there was something satisfying about the progression from natural to modern, from the Ginkgo arcade to the sleek facility beyond.
The park grounds unfolded in carefully planned waves of green and color. Grass and dirt gave way to raised beds where Oddish-shaped topiaries stood guard over a stunning array of irises and wisteria, their petals trembling in the afternoon breeze. A small pond reflected the late sunlight, its surface occasionally broken by what could have been either decorative Magikarp or particularly playful Goldeen.
A lone figure caught my eye, breaking the perfect symmetry of the scene. An elderly man sat on a bench between two trees, his eyes nearly closed but somehow still managing to track my movement. As our gazes met, his face split into a grin that belonged in a different kind of game entirely, the kind that little girls should avoid at all costs.
Ditto tightened slightly around my neck, a silent agreement that perhaps we should speed up our stately progression down Ginkgo Tree Ave. The trees’ shadows suddenly felt less majestic and more like convenient hiding spots for things that smiled too widely.
‘Oookay then,' I thought, picking up my pace while trying to look like I absolutely belonged here and was not at all creeped out by the local bench cryptid. 'Time to see what's behind door number one.'
The automatic doors whispered open with blessed modernity, trading filtered sunlight for fluorescent clarity and the weight of ancient trees for climate-controlled certainty. My relief lasted exactly as long as it took to read the price board mounted on the sleek reception desk.
```
Ace Challenge Fee: ₽100,000
League Challenge Fee: ₽10,000
League Spectator Day Pass: ₽10,000
Gym Challenge Fee: ₽5,000+
Training Facilities Day Pass: ₽4,000
```
The coins in my bag might as well have been pocket lint. I did some quick mental math. The total was somewhere between 'adorably insufficient' and 'why even bother counting.'
The doors whispered open again as I retreated, and the ginkgo path garden stretched before me once more, though now it felt less like a cathedral and more like a very scenic route to nowhere. Clusters of late-blooming irises lined the path, their purple heads nodding in silent sympathy.
I drifted away from the gym's entrance, deliberately choosing a direction that would avoid the creepy bench-dweller.  I let my feet carry me wherever they wanted along the winding garden paths, past bursts of wisteria that draped overhead like purple rain. A breeze stirred the ginkgo leaves, sending a fresh shower of golden fans spiraling down around me. One landed in my hair, and Ditto helpfully brushed it aside for me.
"I don't suppose you know any get-rich-quick schemes for the Pokemon world?" I murmured to my companion. The slight ripple against my neck felt like the Pokemon equivalent of a shrug. "Yeah, didn't think so."
My path meandered away from the gym and its pristine gardens back to the regular grass and dirt training fields where battles had wound down for the day, then back to other sections of garden, though not as maintained as the ones near the gym. 
Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a neat little greenhouse, its glass panels catching the sunset in ways that made it look almost molten. Azaleas clustered around its base, their fading blooms still adding splashes of color to the approaching evening. I didn't know where I was, but something about its warm glow drew me closer.
The greenhouse door handle was too high for comfortable reach, requiring an awkward stretch that reminded me yet again of this body's limitations. 
It scraped open with a sound that felt too loud in the quiet evening air, releasing a wave of warm, humid air that carried the rich scent of earth and growing things. I hesitated for a moment, one foot over the threshold, caught between the fading daylight behind and the green-tinted shadows ahead, but ultimately stepped inside.
A path wound between beds of ferns and clusters of what looked suspiciously like the berries I'd spent countless hours farming in various games. The reality was messier, less orderly than their pixel versions. Leaves overlapped and intertwined, creating patches of shadow that seemed to shift and move in ways that...
I froze. One of the shadows was moving.
A Gloom waddled out from behind a large pot, regarding us with an expression that managed to be both melancholy and curious at the same time. It was smaller than I'd expected, barely coming up to my body's waist, but somehow its presence filled the narrow path between the plants. Neither of us moved for a long moment, caught in a standoff that felt like those tense seconds before a wild Pokemon battle would start in the games.
Except no battle music began. No options appeared. The Gloom just... blinked at us, then yawned, displaying an impressive set of teeth that the games had definitely never rendered in such detail.
"Um, hi?" I offered, my voice coming out in Amber's higher pitch. The word hung in the humid air between us like another drop of condensation.
The Gloom considered this for a moment, then made a sound somewhere between a sigh and a gurgle. It was probably the most accurate representation of its name I'd ever heard. Before I could decide if this was a good sign or not, I felt Ditto begin to slide down my arm.
"Wait, what are you—" I started, but Ditto had already pooled on the ground and was beginning to reshape itself. I watched, fascinated despite my nerves, as it quickly twisted and grew until a second Gloom stood before me, matching the first down to the slightly droopy flower on its head.
The original Gloom perked up immediately, its perpetually sad expression lifting into something approaching delight. It tottered forward, circling Ditto-Gloom with obvious interest. Ditto, for its part, seemed equally fascinated, mimicking the other Pokemon's movements in a sort of impromptu dance.
I quickly glanced around the greenhouse, searching for any witnesses to Ditto's transformation. Nothing but plants and condensation-streaked glass. A relieved sigh escaped me—the last thing I needed was more attention drawn to me.
A beam of late sunlight cut through the glass above, catching the moisture in the air and creating a rainbow that seemed to dance between the leaves. Gloom and Ditto Gloom happily danced together in the sun, the warm rays of light invigorating them both.
“Hey!”
A sudden shout broke the peacefulness and scared Gloom into hiding behind a shadow.
I whipped my head around, Amber's shoulder-length hair swinging with the motion. A girl stood in the doorway, her silhouette sharp against the amber light of sunset. Her purple hair was pulled back in a neat ponytail, accentuating the clean lines of her Celadon Gym uniform—a forest green kimono-style top with darker trim that caught the dying light. The asymmetrical closure and embroidered rainbow badge on her chest marked her as part of the Celadon gym. A Bellsprout swayed beside her, its vine-like neck moving with an alien grace.
"What are you doing in here?" She couldn't have been more than fifteen, but her voice carried the weight of practiced authority. The kind that came from memorizing rules and desperately wanting to prove you could enforce them. The Bellsprout's head bobbed in a rhythmic counterpoint to her words.
"I..." The explanation died somewhere between my brain and my mouth. The humid air felt heavier suddenly, pressing down with the weight of being caught for... caught for what exactly? Watching two Pokemon play? The absurdity of it almost made me laugh, but something in her stance suggested that might not be the wisest response.
The girl stepped forward, her gym uniform crisp despite the greenhouse humidity. "This is a restricted area," she continued, eyes narrowing as she looked between me and the remaining Gloom. Then she paused, something clicking behind her eyes. "Wait. That's not one of our Gloom, is it?"
As if betrayed by the very words, Ditto's perfect Gloom form wavered, a ripple of pink breaking through the illusion like a blush spreading across someone's cheeks. The real Gloom, still half-hidden in shadow, made a sound somewhere between disappointment and embarrassment.
The gym trainer's eyes widened, all pretense of authority momentarily forgotten. "What... what kind of Pokémon is that?" She took half a step forward, then caught herself. She shook her head, visibly forcing herself back into her official role, though her eyes kept darting to Ditto's now pink form with poorly concealed fascination.
"There are signs everywhere saying 'Do Not Enter' and 'Staff Only,'" she said, gesturing vaguely behind her, though her stern tone had lost its edge. Then her eyes tracked down to my height, really seeing me for the first time, and something in her expression softened.
"I'm sorry," I managed, the words coming out smaller than intended. "We were just..." Just what? Playing? Exploring? Breaking and entering? None of those explanations seemed likely to help our case.
The girl's expression shifted, authority melting into something closer to concern. "Where are your parents?" she asked, her voice gentler now. The Bellsprout beside her swayed less aggressively, its head tilting in curiosity.
'Parents.' The word hit like a punch to the gut. In my head, I was old enough that the question felt absurd, but the reflection in the greenhouse glass told a different story. A small girl with shoulder-length hair, looking very much like she should, in fact, have a parent nearby.
"My father's..." I started, then stopped. What could I say? 'My father's a genetics researcher who thinks I'm his resurrected daughter because technically I am, just with a bonus hitchhiking consciousness from another dimension, and left me in an apartment alone with instructions not to leave but I left anyway because I wanted to explore this brand new world'? Even in a world with Pokemon, that felt like a stretch.
The girl sighed, absently adjusting her purple ponytail. "Listen," she said, "I didn't mean to scare you. Just... if you see a sign that says 'Do Not Enter,' please don't enter, okay? This is a restricted area. These Pokemon aren't used to visitors."
I nodded slowly while backing away, motioning for Ditto to follow. Internally, I was screaming at myself. How could I have just walked into a restricted area?
The greenhouse door felt miles away, my short legs taking what seemed like an eternity to cross the distance. The handle itself posed a regular challenge—too high for comfortable reach. I managed to push it open with a grunt, cool evening air rushing in to break the greenhouse's humid spell.
It wasn't until we were several steps away that I finally looked up and saw it – the 'RESTRICTED - DO NOT ENTER' sign, mounted well above child-height on the greenhouse wall. I groaned internally. Of course, it was there. Of course, I'd managed to miss it.
The trees cast longer shadows now, their leaves turning from gold to deep amber in the setting sun. I shuffled away from the greenhouse, trying to maintain some dignity while essentially fleeing the scene of my latest misadventure. Ditto kept pace beside me, its amorphous form somehow managing to convey both sympathy and mild judgment.
"Ah-CHOO!"
The sound barely registered before something slammed into me from behind. The world tilted, and suddenly I was studying the leaves from ground level, my back pressed against the cold stone path. Through watering eyes, I caught a glimpse of someone scrambling to collect a fallen Pokemon—an Oddish, its leafy sprouts drooping and wilted, round body curled defensively, and its red eyes swirling from the fall.
"S-sorry!" came a strangled voice, followed by another explosive sneeze. The girl—maybe fourteen or fifteen—only glanced at me for a moment before she hurriedly gathered up her unconscious Pokemon. Her face was flushed, eyes red and running, and she vanished around a corner before I could even push myself to a sitting position.
Ditto oozed closer, helping me up with a concerned ripple through its body. I brushed dirt from my dress, wincing at the brown stains that would definitely require an explanation later.
"Time to go home," I sighed to Ditto, though 'home' still felt like the wrong word for Dr. Fuji's apartment. “Today’s been a fruitfully long day of adventure.”
</Chapter>

<Chapter title="[Chapter 6] Scientist Fuji" file="story/chapter6.txt">
The photo album barely fit on the fold-out card table, its leather-bound elegance a stark contrast to the hastily assembled furniture around it. Dawn painted thin strips of light through the apartment's single window, the shadows of Celadon's towering apartments creating a striped pattern across the worn carpet.
Fuji turned another page with practiced care, the album's weight making the card table wobble. Each photograph was a window into a past that felt increasingly like someone else's life—birthday parties, beach trips, family dinners in a house that no longer belonged to him. His thumb traced the edge of a particular image: Amber at seven, twirling in a light blue sundress that made her look like a piece of sky brought down to earth. Her mother had sewn it herself, spending weeks getting the pleats just right.
"Perfect," he whispered, carefully removing the photo. The apartment's thin walls carried the sound of his chair scraping back, a neighbor's Meowth yowling in protest at the noise. Three steps took him across the narrow hallway to Amber's room—no longer a museum of memories, but a blank canvas of rental beige, hastily decorated with the few family portraits he'd managed to save.
He paused at her door, today's chosen dress draped over his arm. An exact replica of the one in the photograph, down to the last stitch of white trim. He hung the dress carefully on the doorknob, adjusting it three times before he was satisfied.
The kitchenette felt like a dollhouse version of their old one, everything scaled down and simplified. His wedding ring clinked against the cheap aluminum pan as he reached for it, the sound sharp in the morning silence. She had always insisted on making breakfast herself—said it wasn't proper to start the day without a homemade meal. Now he performed a cramped imitation of their old life, careful not to bump his elbows against the narrow counters as he cracked eggs into the pan.
Three plates, three sets of chopsticks, three glasses of juice, all arranged on a table meant for one. The third setting sat like a promise at the empty end of the tiny table, waiting.
He was nearly done when he heard movement from Amber's room. His hands stilled on the last plate, listening for... something. A sign. A word. Anything that might tell him if today would be different. But there was only the soft padding of feet and the quiet click of a door.
Breakfast passed in silence. Questions died unasked in the space between them, their knees almost touching under the small table. He watched her pick at her food, noted how she held her chopsticks—all wrong, nothing like before—and added it to his mental list of differences to fix later.
"Go get dressed," he said quietly after they finished.
While she changed, he placed the dishes in the sink and set up the VCR player, an old tape of "Adventures of Pikachu & Friends" whirring to life.
When she stepped out in the blue dress, Fuji averted his gaze from the way she tugged at the collar, her fingers clawing at the trim as if it were choking her. Amber loved this dress—he reminded himself of that, clinging to the memory of her delight in every stitch of these resurrected gifts.
“Stop that!” The words erupted from him, sharp and unbidden.
Amber froze, her hands hesitating at the collar before drifting warily to her sides.
“Just a rebellious phase,” Fuji muttered under his breath, turning toward his room to gather his things—folders swollen with data, security cards, and a single photograph slipped into his breast pocket. Not the one from this morning—that would return to the album—but another, its image so etched in his mind he didn’t need to glance at it.
“I’ll likely be late tonight… again,” he said, the phrase worn smooth by repetition. “Ditto will—”
“Ditto will watch me. I know,” she cut in, her voice edged with a sigh as her eyes rolled upward.
Fuji’s arm snapped up, a coiled spring of frustration, hovering midair. Amber flinched, her arms rising instinctively to shield herself, a reflex that struck him like a cold gust.
Fuji forced his hand back down slowly and took a few deep breaths. “Mind your tone, young lady.”
Another discrepancy. Another flaw to note and mend later.
He exhaled sharply, then turned to slip on his shoes. At the door, keys weighing heavy in his palm, he lingered, hoping for… something. A farewell? A flicker of warmth? The echo of what once was? But Amber had already retreated into her own world, her back to him, lost in whatever thoughts filled her mind these days.
The stairwell lights still hadn't been fixed, leaving his descent in that peculiar twilight that made every shadow look like a memory trying to take shape. In his pocket, the photograph pressed against his heart like a wound that refused to heal—the three of them at the beach, Amber holding her mother's hat against the wind, her other hand clutching his lab coat. He pushed through the door at ground level, stepping into the morning light of a city that had long since moved on without him.
-[v.v]-
The Game Corner's neon signs cast sickly patterns across the morning crowd, their faces bathed in artificial twilight despite the sun outside. Fuji moved through the sea of early gamblers with practiced indifference, his coat pocket heavy with the photo he refused to look at again. The sound of slot machines created a hypnotic rhythm—clicks and whirs and electronic chimes that almost masked the sound of footsteps behind him.
He reached the back wall, fingers finding the hidden panel by memory. The poster above advertised "Big Wins!" in garish colors, a Meowth's golden coin reflecting nothing. Three precise taps, pause, two more. A slim card reader emerged with barely a whisper. He drew the white keycard from his inner pocket, its magnetic strip worn from repeated use. The wall slid away with hydraulic efficiency when he swiped it.
The stairwell beyond was everything the Game Corner wasn't—sterile, silent, serious. Another swipe at the bottom of the stairs, this time with the higher-clearance black card. The temperature dropped with each step, the air taking on that distinctive underground chill. Even the sounds changed—the muffled thump of his footsteps against metal stairs replacing the chaos of slot machines above.
"Dr. Fuji!" The voice echoed off polished surfaces. A young man in a lab coat hurried toward him, a folder clutched like a shield. "I have those documents you requested forged, doctor."
Fuji accepted the folder without breaking stride, Gideon falling into step beside him. The younger scientist's nervousness manifested in a constant stream of words.
"I backdated everything through the hospital records—birth certificate, vaccination records, doctor’s notes, check-ups, everything. Anyone who looks will find a perfectly ordinary ten-year-old girl who’s lived here all her life." Gideon paused, glancing sideways, a slight blush coloring his cheeks. "Oh, and Agent Domino was asking about you last night. Said she has something you'll find interesting. She's at the Rose Heights Apartments, Unit 742."
The conference room door loomed ahead, voices already leaking through. Fuji's hand tightened on the folder, creasing its edge. "Thank you, Dr. Gideon. That will be all."
"Doctor?" Gideon hesitated. "About the meeting... some of the admins are saying—"
The conference room hummed with barely contained chaos. Screens covered every wall—damage reports on the left, casualty lists straight ahead, power readings to the right. Junior scientists clustered in the back corners like anxious Rattata, while admins claimed the chairs closest to the vacant seat at the head of the table.
Fuji took his seat at the table's midpoint—likely no longer the head of his own research division—and opened Gideon’s folder of forged records. He didn’t need the position now anyway.
"Twenty-three dead," Admin Archer began without preamble. "Forty-five support staff. Billions in equipment." He stood at the room's front, hands clasped behind his back, reflection fractured across the wall of screens. "And a weapon of unprecedented power loose in the world, when it should’ve been under our control." His eyes were fixed on Fuji. "Would you care to explain how this happened, Doctor?"
"I've already explained in the previous meetings." Fuji's voice sagged with fatigue. Even still, he opened his folder, beginning a methodical review of Gideon's forged documents, each page a lifeline to a daughter he was trying to hold together.
"Dr. Fuji!" Archer's hands slammed onto the conference table. Coffee cups rattled. A junior researcher in the back dropped her clipboard.
"Dr. Samba," Dr. Sebastian quickly interrupted, turning the attention away from Dr. Fuji. "Perhaps you could explain the sequence of events from your monitoring station?"
"Ah, yes." Dr. Samba stood, her hands steady as she manipulated the central display. Multiple graphs materialized, showing increasingly erratic patterns. "The readings were unprecedented from the start. Even in stasis, its psychic signature exceeded our strongest Alakazam baseline by several orders of magnitude. But look here—" She highlighted a specific timestamp. "At 0247 hours, a huge spike in brain activity followed."
"The containment system—" Archer started.
"Was operating at maximum capacity," Samba continued, advancing through her data. "But the power levels kept climbing. Each spike was stronger than the last, until..." The graph shot upward, disappearing off the scale. "Until—"
"Until it escaped." Archer interrupted. "We created something we couldn't control."
"The evolutionary acceleration was unprecedented," Dr. Zager added, leaning forward. His excitement briefly overcame his caution. "If we could replicate even a fraction of that growth rate in other specimens—"
"Replicate?" Dr. Namba's laugh held no humor. "Half of our other research was destroyed. Most of it… gone. The legendary capture systems, the fusion experiments..." He finally glanced at the photographs of the ruins behind her. "The Evolution Acceleration lab is a crater. Twenty years of strength augmentation research, gone."
“Your strength augmentation machine barely worked anyway," Dr. Sebastian said with a dismissive wave. “The serum developed by Silph Co. is better.”
“That serum is unstable and unpredictable. My strength augmentation machine—”
The room erupted into overlapping arguments. A junior researcher waved printouts of energy readings. Two admins argued about cover stories while Dr. Sebastian and Dr. Namba's debate about the efficacies of the strength augmentation system devolved into a shouting match about research priorities.
Through it all, Fuji continued reading his documents, marking errors that didn’t make sense. Each forged page helping to build the foundation of his daughter's new existence. Only occasionally did his eyes flick to the photographs of the ruined facility, lingering on the massive hole torn through three sublevels—the path of Mewtwo's destruction.
The door opened.
The change in the room was instant. Scientists who had been shouting moments ago snapped upright in their chairs. Archer's face went pale. Even Dr. Namba's sharp retort died in her throat. The temperature seemed to drop several degrees.
Giovanni entered like he was taking a casual stroll through one of his gardens. His Persian padded silently beside him, its eyes scanning the room with predatory intensity. The gem on its forehead caught the fluorescent light, casting tiny red reflections across the walls. He wore a charcoal suit that probably cost more than most of the scientists made in a year, every line of it perfect despite the early hour.
"Please," he said, his voice smooth as silk, "don't let me interrupt." He took the empty seat at the head of the table, Persian curling at his feet. No one moved. "I simply thought I should... personally assess the situation."
His eyes found Fuji, who had finally looked up from his papers. The two men regarded each other for a long moment—the crime lord and the scientist, each seeing something in the other that the rest of the room couldn't quite grasp.
“My investment?” Giovanni asked, staring at Fuji.
"Your investment," Fuji echoed, meeting Giovanni's gaze with the same detached interest he'd shown his papers, "exceeded all parameters. The enhanced clone demonstrated power levels beyond anything in recorded history.”
"What about its personality? You mixed some human DNA, correct?" Giovanni's question carried a weight that seemed to thicken the air.
Dr. Fuji paused, contemplating the question. His eyes drifted to the wall of monitors behind Giovanni's desk. "As demonstrated by the almost complete destruction of the facility, I believe it thinks like a human, not a Pokemon. It carries human ambition and human desires. And..." he turned back to Giovanni, his voice dropping slightly, "it may hold grudges."
"Then it can understand reason," Giovanni replied, his lips curving into a slight smile. He gestured for the meeting to continue, settling back in his chair like a theatergoer at a particularly amusing play.
Dr. Sebastian cleared his throat, clicking through his presentation. "The forced evolution serum research was largely preserved. We managed to save both the formula and the latest trial."
"What about the fusion experiments?" Archer interrupted.
"The successful specimens were killed in the collapse," A scientist said, her voice tight. "Though frankly, given their condition, perhaps that was a mercy."
“And the legendary capture projects?”
Dr. Zager pulled up a new set of files. "Most of our legendary capture research data was recovered. The theoretical frameworks for containing Mew, the legendary birds, even Celebi—"
"Theoretical being the operative word," someone muttered.
"The equipment was lost," Zager continued, ignoring the comment. "But considering we haven't actually located any of these Pokemon besides Mew, rebuilding the containment units isn't our highest priority."
“Before we discuss future legendary projects," Archer cut in, "what about the immediate threat? Can we capture Mewtwo, the clone of a legendary?" He turned to Fuji. "Doctor, exactly how strong is this thing?"
Fuji looked up from his papers, something flickering behind his eyes—a flash of annoyance at yet another interruption of his reading. But after a moment's consideration, he set the documents aside with exaggerated care.
"As we've discussed already," he began, emphasizing each word like he was speaking to particularly slow students, "the psychic readings were beyond our highest measuring capabilities. Far stronger than any trained Pokemon we've documented. Likely on par with legendary Pokemon, at minimum." He picked up his papers again, adding almost as an afterthought: "It was designed for battle, after all."
"Could the legendary containment systems for Mew work on it?" Ariana asked.
Dr. Zager shook his head. "Those were designed around Mew's specific abilities—transformation, teleportation. Mewtwo..." He paused, studying the destruction footage. "Mewtwo is far more aggressive."
Through the ensuing debate, Giovanni remained silent, his dark eyes studying each speaker in turn. His Persian stretched lazily at his feet, tail flicking with each raised voice. Only when the arguments began cycling back on themselves did he finally speak, his quiet words cutting through the chaos.
"Dr. Fuji." The room fell silent. "Could another be created? With the few Mew DNA samples we have left?"
Fuji looked up from his papers again, a flash of annoyance at the interruption. But this wasn't Archer or one of the other administrators. This was Giovanni.
"The successful synthesis was, honestly, more luck than science," Fuji replied, his tone carefully modulated. "We're not entirely sure what triggered its awakening." He held Giovanni's gaze for a moment longer than strictly necessary before returning to his documents.
"But could you? Make one? One more... amenable to our goals?" Giovanni's voice remained gentle, almost conversational. The room held its breath.
Fuji's hand stilled on his papers. For the first time in the meeting, his detachment wavered. A new thought flickered through his mind—not just another Mewtwo, but another chance at perfection. Another Amber, one who wouldn't tug at her dress or roll her eyes or hold her chopsticks wrong...
"...It's possible," he responded, not looking up, his fingers unconsciously tightening on the forged hospital records of his current "success."
The afternoon dragged on all the way into night. Status updates from field operatives revealed no more psychic disturbances, suggesting Mewtwo had already learned to mask its signature. Division heads argued over resource allocation, blame shifted like shadows, and through it all, Giovanni watched, occasionally asking a pointed question that would send discussions spiraling in new directions.
"The Evolution Research Division needs priority funding—"
"Funding? Half our containment specialists are dead—"
"If we could replicate even a fraction of Mewtwo's power level—"
"Did you see what it did to the psychic dampeners? They melted—"
“Our supporters wouldn’t have the funds—”
The sun had set by the time Giovanni stood, silencing the room once more. "I expect daily updates," he said simply. He stood to leave, his Persian following like a shadow.
The meeting fractured into smaller arguments, then into resigned silence. Scientists and Admins gathered their materials, some still debating in hushed tones about containment protocols and power readings that had exceeded their equipment's maximum scale.
Fuji stood with them, hurriedly gathering his other papers. His fingers brushed against the photograph in his pocket—a reflexive check, like ensuring a key was still there.
He had another meeting to attend.
-[v.v]-
Rose Heights Apartments loomed over the northern edge of Celadon City, its modern glass facade reflecting the soft glow of the moon. Fuji took the elevator to the seventh floor, his reflection in the mirrored walls looking more worn than he remembered. The fluorescent lights made the shadows under his eyes deeper and turned his lab coat a sickly shade of yellow.
Domino opened the door in exercise clothes, a gym towel around her neck. Sweat gleamed on her skin, but her smile was perfectly composed. "Dr. Fuji. You’re very late."
He followed her into an apartment that was notably sparse—a few pieces of furniture, no personal items visible. Exercise equipment dominated one corner, news with captions playing silently on the TV.
"Trying to track down your wife after, what, fifteen years?" Domino grabbed a water bottle, her tone playful.
"The timing is right," Fuji said quietly. "Everything is finally in place."
"You mean... Mewtwo?" She studied him for a moment, then shrugged and picked up a folder from the coffee table. "Well, I did find something interesting."
She held it just out of reach, smile sharpening. "New address, a few photos, some documents. Just... don't be too shocked, okay? Fifteen years is a long time."
Fuji nodded, snatching the folder out of her hand.
Inside the folder, time had continued without him. A more recent photo stared up from the top of the stack. Her auburn hair was pulled back in that familiar ponytail, barely touched by gray. She was crouched among the freshly planted garden, laughing at something off-camera, her face as youthful and bright as he remembered. His fingers traced the edge of the frame, carefully covering the man standing beside her.
"It's natural, you know," Domino said, "For her to want companionship after all this time."
He nodded slowly, still staring at the half-covered photo. The anger he'd expected didn't come—just a strange, hollow certainty that this too was temporary. Just another obstacle to overcome.
As he walked back through the darkening city streets, he whispered her name like a hypothesis waiting to be proven: "Delia..."
</Chapter>

<Chapter title="[Chapter 7] Side Quests Galore" file="story/chapter7.txt">
I pressed my face against the window, counting Dr. Fuji's steps as he made his way down the street. His white lab coat caught the morning sun until he disappeared around the corner. I waited another ten minutes, watching the numbers tick by on the ancient digital clock above the stove.
The shiny black patent leather shoes still pinched with every step, but today I had something the previous adventure lacked: money. Three hundred pokedollars’ worth of coins sat tucked deeply in my faded purple backpack along with the usual snacks, food, and spare keys.
"Ready for landmark number 2?" I whispered, rolling a minified Pokeball between my fingers. The sphere gave a slight wobble that somehow managed to convey reluctance. After yesterday's battle, we'd agreed Ditto should stay hidden—well, I'd insisted and Ditto had blob-shrugged in what I chose to interpret as agreement.
Nobody had really seemed to care about Ditto hanging around my shoulders yesterday—in a city where Machop worked ticket booths and Meowth handled currency, another Pokemon companion barely raised an eyebrow.
But the reaction to that battle changed a few things. It didn't take a Team Rocket scientist to connect the dots that the Ditto failed Mew clone theory was true. One glimpse from a Team Rocket Scientist of a Ditto with a girl who looked exactly like Amber Fuji, and we’d probably never be able to go on another adventure.
The same elevated train station from yesterday loomed ahead. I slipped through the morning crowd toward the row of booths, ignoring how Mr. Mime's exaggerated gestures made invisible walls to guide everyone else into orderly lines. Watching him work was fascinating, but I had a mission.
I checked the price board mounted above the booths. A day pass was listed at ₽300 for children. Perfect—suspiciously exactly what I'd won from yesterday's battle.
The ticket line was mercifully short—just a couple arguing over a regional rail map, and an elderly man who seemed to be paying entirely in ₽10 pieces that he kept producing from increasingly improbable pocket locations. The Machop manning the booth maintained an admirably stoic expression as it created neat stacks of copper-colored coins, each new pile adding to what looked like a miniature city of currency. "Chop, ma-chop," it muttered with each new stack.
When my turn came, I emptied my own collection onto the metal tray—three hundred pokedollars in various denominations, all earned from yesterday's battle. The Machop looked down at me, then around, looked down at me again, and accepting my coin with a gruff "Ma."
The Machop's movements were musical—each coin got a quick tap against the counter that rang out with different pitches, like it was testing for counterfeits through sound alone.
"Machop... machop... ma," it counted under its breath, each syllable matching the metallic ring of the coins.
Only after the final coin sang its metallic note did the Machop nod and reach for the ticket printer. The card that emerged looked like a standard transit card—thin plastic with a magnetic stripe down one side. Before I could look closer, the Machop thrust its hand out, pointing firmly at the turnstiles while holding the card under its fingers, barking out a final "Chop!"
"Thank you!" I chirped, taking the card and trying not to crush it in my nervous fingers. 
The text along the top read "CELADON METRO" in bright blue letters, with "24-HOUR PASS" printed below in smaller type. The card itself had that peculiar well-worn flexibility of polyester, already slightly curved from being stored in stacks. Something about its mundane imperfection was oddly comforting—like finding a familiar book in a foreign library.
The morning crowd flowed around me like water around a rock, their shoes creating a constant susurration against the worn tile floor. Commuters were swiping their cards with the kind of mindless efficiency that comes from doing something a thousand times, their movements as practiced as a choreographed dance. Many had their passes on retractable badge holders, the cards zipping back to their hips with satisfying little clicks after each swipe.
I wasn't from a big city, but I had been to the Big Apple a few times, where they had exactly this kind of card. The memory felt strange now—like remembering a movie I'd watched rather than a life I'd lived.
When it reached my turn, I stretched on my tiptoes and gave it a swipe, the plastic warm from being clutched in my sweaty palm. The reader's display flickered to life with three angry red dots.
Beep-beep-beep.
I pushed against the turnstile, only for it to respond with the mechanical equivalent of a shrug. The metal bar pressed cold and unyielding against my hip, somehow both exactly like and completely different from the New York City subway I remembered.
I glanced back at the person behind me, a middle-aged businessman in a suit a bit too tight for him. His collar was already dark with sweat despite the early hour, and his expression suggested I was single-handedly responsible for every train delay he'd ever experienced.
Heat crept up my neck as I embarrassingly trudged back to swipe again. The card felt flimsier now, like it might dissolve under the weight of everyone's stares. 
Beep-beep-click.
This time, the turnstile yielded with a smooth motion that nearly sent me stumbling forward. I caught myself just in time to avoid face-planting into the stairs, though I could have sworn I heard the businessman's Meowth snicker.
I made my way up the stairs, legs already protesting at the climb. The shoes—patent leather torture devices that they were—clicked against each metal step with embarrassing loudness.
I found an empty seat by the window. The seat's patterned fabric had that particular synthetic smoothness that comes from thousands of passengers, worn down to something almost soft.
The train lurched forward with a gentle whine, and I watched Celadon scroll past like a living postcard. From up here, the city looked almost like my old world—until a flock of Pidgey swooped past the window, catching the morning light on their wings. One of them carried what looked like a small package, probably some local delivery service.
Several stops later, the automated announcement system crackled to life: "Now approaching: Pokemon Center Station. Please mind the gap." The voice had that particular quality of all transit recordings—somehow both cheerful and dead inside at the same time. Some things really were universal.
The train glided to a stop at an underground station far larger and more polished than the downtown platforms. The tunnels here branched out into a network of corridors, all leading toward a central atrium that rose through the heart of the Pokemon Center itself. Chansey-pink support columns stretched upward, their bases decorated with mosaics depicting various healing berries.
I followed the small crowd up a series of escalators, each one carrying us closer to what sounded like a bustling lobby above. The underground passage was surprisingly pleasant—clean white tiles and soft lighting, with occasional potted plants that I strongly suspected were tended by Grass-type Pokemon.
The escalator deposited me into the Pokemon Center's main lobby. I had to stop myself from gasping audibly. The familiar game sprite had done nothing to prepare me for the sheer scale of it all. The ceiling soared overhead, its curving panels dotted with what looked like miniature Heal Balls that cast a warm, diffused light throughout the space.
From where I stood, the lobby branched into three distinct areas separated by sleek glass partitions. To my right, through a set of glass doors, I could see a paved road leading to what appeared to be training fields in the distance. The morning sun caught the glass at just the right angle to reveal a faint, iridescent sheen—probably some kind of protective coating against stray Pokemon moves.
To my left stood what could only be the medical wing, dominated by a curved reception counter that looked like the world's most advanced help desk. A Nurse Joy—and wasn't that a trip, seeing one in person—efficiently managed the flow of trainers and Pokemon. Behind the frosted glass partitions that separated the public area from the treatment rooms, I caught glimpses of Chansey moving between stations with practiced grace. The familiar Poké Ball logo pulsed softly on wall-mounted screens above, displaying wait times and status updates in gently glowing text.
However, straight ahead, a separate lobby stretched out. A cluster of trainers, mostly older ones—well, older than me right now—gathered around an extensive bulletin board. I watched as they occasionally selected papers and brought them to a separate set of receptionists. I was unsure what this was.
I debated between the two sides before ultimately turning toward the unfamiliar section straight ahead. In the games, Pokemon Centers were just hospitals and sometimes item shops. There was nothing like this in any of the games.
The bulletin board loomed before me, a maze of paper and possibility that made my knowledge of the pokemon games suddenly feel inadequate. "A... job board?" I muttered, caught between fascination and confusion. The papers pinned to cork seemed almost archaic compared to the Center's otherwise modern aesthetic. It almost seemed like the job boards for the mystery dungeon games… but that wasn’t a game with any humans in it, besides the protagonist.
I reached for one of the sheets before catching myself, suddenly aware of how out of place I must look. Around me, trainers moved with the easy confidence of people who'd done this a thousand times, scanning notices and occasionally plucking papers free with practiced motions. Meanwhile, I stood frozen like a tourist at a museum.
A nearby trainer brushed past, his Growlithe padding dutifully at his heels as he yanked a piece green-tinted paper from the board. Neither spared me a glance, too focused on whatever job had caught their attention. I found myself envying their certainty, their obvious belonging in this space that still felt more like a game map than reality.
'Well,' I thought, forcing myself to actually focus on the papers instead of just staring like an idiot, ‘no one's going to arrest me for reading.'
The cork board stretched out before me, a patchwork of colored papers that seemed to tell stories of an entire region. My eyes were immediately drawn to the right side, where crimson papers demanded attention with bold lettering and stark warnings. A proper WANTED poster—and wasn't that a shock to see in a Pokemon Center—displayed a grainy photo of a Hypno. The text warned of a "mass sleep incident" in Saffron City, with a staggering ₽2,000,000 reward for capture. It was apparently class A, whatever that meant.
"They really printed them like old Western posters," I muttered, noting the dramatic 'WANTED' header.
Moving left, I found a much more varied assortment of colors. Yellow [Rescue] notices confused me. Why were there so many about retrieving "fainted" Pokemon left in forests? Who abandons their Pokemon like that but still wanted them back? The descriptions were vague, but the urgency in the writing was clear.
Then, there were orange papers marked [Defeat]. Most seemed to involve removing problem Pokemon from settled areas—a group of Grimer in the sewers, aggressive Spearow near farms. One notice caught my eye: "[Defeat] Rogue Eevee and Eeveelutions Route 7 - Exercise Caution. (Class C)”. Something about it tickled my memory—but I couldn’t quite place it.
Finally, on the far left, white papers marked [Item] offered gentler tasks. "[Item] Berry Collection - Celadon Hills (Class D)" promising oddly decent pay for some wild berry picking.
Movement near the board caught my eye—someone in forest green pinning up a new notice. I almost looked away before recognizing the purple ponytail: the same gym trainer from yesterday.
I curiously inched toward the new notice, reading the bolded letters at the top: "[WANTED] Thief that stole a Oddish from Celadon Gym Greenhouse."
‘Oddish? Hadn’t I seen a Oddish bef—’
"Ah!" The trainer's shout cracked through the center's buzz. Her small stack of notices scattered across the floor as she jumped back, pokeball appearing in her hand with practiced speed. The morning chatter died instantly. "It's you!"
My heart jumped at the shout. That wasn't the polite surprise of someone remembering a brief encounter—it was the sharp accusation of someone who'd caught a thief. Which was ridiculous, because I hadn't done anything wrong.
Had I?
My mind raced through yesterday's events: sneaking into the greenhouse (okay, that wasn't great), playing with the Gloom (which, now that I thought about it, probably wasn't allowed), getting caught (definitely not great)...
"I didn't do it," I said quickly, holding up my hands. The words came out too fast, too defensive. Great. Now I sounded exactly like someone who'd stolen something.
The trainer lowered her pokeball slightly, but her stance remained ready. "You were in the greenhouse yesterday, right before the Oddish went missing." Her voice carried the tired weight of someone who'd been dealing with this situation for hours.
"I mean, yes, I was there, but—"
"You have to come with me." It wasn't a request. The gym trainer’s grip on her pokeball tightened, though she at least wasn't pointing it at me anymore. "I will need your statement."
I glanced around the Center. The morning crowd had mostly gone silent, their attention locked on our little drama. Even the healing station's chime felt judgmental now.
I nodded, making sure to keep Ditto’s pokeball small. It felt impossibly heavy between my fingertips. 
The gym trainer gestured toward the door, not bothering to pick up the fallen notices, "After you."

<Chapter title="[Chapter 8] Start of an Unpaid Side Quest" file="story/chapter8.txt">
“What’s your name?” Mary—who'd introduced herself during our tense walk back to the gym with all the warmth of a Glaceon—asked.
The question hit harder than it should have. In my past life, I would've answered without hesitation. Now? Now I was technically inhabiting a clone of Amber Fuji, but admitting that here would raise more questions than I could handle.
"Amber," I said finally, the name feeling both true and false on my tongue. Mary's eyes narrowed slightly at my hesitation, but she didn't press further.
Instead, she led me through the sprawling gym complex, revealing a whole new dimension of Pokemon training I'd never imagined. Indoor grass field battling rings stretched out in vast chambers, their floors marked with the scars of countless showdowns. In one room, a Victreebel demonstrated some kind of high-speed vine technique to a group of students. In another, a trainer and her Tangrowth were locked in an intense sparring match that involved more strategic retreating than actual attacking. Even after watching battles in the park, each new sight showed me just how much more there was to learn about real Pokemon training.
But she wasn't here to give me a tour of the gym. She steered us away from its grand training halls and into its darker arteries—maintenance corridors and back passages where the polished presentation gave way to practical necessity. We passed a break room where a Bellsprout was delicately operating a coffee maker, then a storage area that smelled strongly of fertilizer. Finally, she stopped at a door that looked like it had started life as a supply closet before getting promoted beyond its qualifications. A small plaque read "Security" in letters that seemed almost embarrassed about their placement.
She ushered me into what could barely be called a security office—more like a converted storage room. A few screens showed key areas of the gym complex, including the greenhouse where I'd been caught earlier. A Tangela stood at the main console, its vines deftly tapping buttons and swiping through different camera feeds. In the corner, a drowsy-looking girl with messy brown hair jolted upright at our entrance, her glasses slightly askew as she hastily smoothed her rumpled uniform.
"Kayla," Mary's voice cut through the room like a Scyther's blade. "Did you find the footage?"
"Oh, uh, yeah. I did," Kayla mumbled, adjusting her glasses as she shook her monitor to consciousness with all the urgency of a hibernating Snorlax. I watched her hunt-and-peck through folders like someone's grandmother discovering computers for the first time, each uncertain click of the mouse adding another layer to the increasingly awkward silence.
When she finally pulled up the video, I got to experience one of yesterday's greatest hits: starring me, the world's least subtle intruder. It was still jarring to see myself—this smaller anime-haired version that my brain refused to fully accept as 'me'—wandering into the greenhouse with all the situational awareness of a Psyduck. The grainy black-and-white feed reduced most of everything to abstract shapes moving through fog, like watching security footage from the original Game Boy era. Still, even through the visual soup, you could kinda tell it was me.
My stomach clenched as I watched Ditto transform. If Team Rocket somehow got their hands on this footage and gave it to Dr. Fuji, I would probably never be able to go on another adventure soon.
The grainy feed rolled on, documenting my inglorious exit exactly as it had happened—empty-handed and looking more like a confused tourist than a master thief. Mary's expression darkened as she watched, her earlier suspicion morphing into barely contained frustration.
"Hold on…" The footage blurred as Kayla tapped through it a tiny bit. "There!"
On screen was a girl who was much older than me practically sprinting through the greenhouse being chased by what looked to be half its inhabitants. A Vileplume skittered after her with surprising anger, followed by some flying Combee and a lone Parasect. A pair of Gloom brought up the rear, their movements suggesting they were none too pleased about this disturbance.
Even through the grainy footage, her desperation was clear—one hand clutching something to her chest, the other pressed against her face as she stumbled past the camera, randomly pulling her head back and forth.
"That's not me," I said quickly, still trying to process the sheer absurdity of what they were accusing me of.
"There was a theft," Mary said slowly. She gestured at the screen where the chaos was still unfolding in grainy black and white. "And here you were, wandering into our restricted greenhouse right before, managing to pull me away from my rounds with your..." she waved her hand vaguely, "Situation. That's quite a coincidence, don't you think?"
Oh. Oh. My brain finally caught up to what Mary was implying. From their perspective, I must have looked like the world's most obvious distraction—the bumbling accomplice sent to draw security away while the real thief did the dirty work. Which... okay, yeah, that actually made an uncomfortable amount of sense.
For a moment, all I could do was stare at her, my mouth slightly agape. The security room suddenly felt even smaller, the wall of screens casting an accusatory glow. Everyone watched me with varying degrees of suspicion. Only the Tangela seemed indifferent to the drama, its vines continuing their steady rhythm across the control panel like a bored stenographer taking notes.
"I..." I started, then stopped, unsure of what to say next. 
I stared at the screen instead of trying to defend myself, watching the girl's frantic dance with her pursuers. Something about her…
"Wait! I think I recognize her," I said, the memory suddenly crystallizing like a Pokemon evolution cutscene. The collision, the mumbled apology, the knocked-out Oddish. Watching the footage now, every detail clicked into place like the world's most suspicious jigsaw puzzle.
Everyone in the tiny room leaned forward slightly, even the diligent Tangela.
"Uh, no. I just..." I watched the girl on screen jerk her head back in another violent almost sneeze. "She bumped into me while she was, you know, stealing the Oddish. I even saw her drop the Oddish."
Mary's shoulders slumped, disappointment evident. Then she squared them again, her expression hardening into something more official. "If you don't tell us who she is, you'll be in very big trouble."
I waved my hands frantically. "No, no. I really don't know her. It’s all just a coincidence."
We stared at each other for what felt like hours, though the timestamps clicking by on the screens said it was closer to ten seconds. 
I glanced at my bag, where Ditto's pokeball rested inside. An idea started forming—the kind that either solved everything or made it monumentally worse. But hey, when you're already suspected of being an accomplice to Pokemon theft, how much worse could it get?
"Um," I started, fingers trailing toward my bag. "I might be able to help with identifying her. Since you've already seen what my Ditto can do..." I looked at Mary hopefully. "Would it be okay if I used it? It's really good with faces."
Mary's eyebrows rose slightly, but she nodded. "Go ahead."
I pulled out Ditto's ball, the weight of everyone's attention making my hands clumsy. The security room felt even smaller now, crowded with anticipation. "Ditto, could you transform into the girl from last night? The one who ran into us yesterday?"
Ditto emerged with its usual cheerful burble, and for a moment I saw puzzlement cross Mary's face. Then Ditto began to change. Kayla actually took a step back, her glasses slipping down her nose as she stared.
Ditto emerged with its usual cheerful burble and hung there, its blob-like form wobbling slightly. Kayla did a double-take as she adjusted her glasses.
“A Grimer?”
“No, its…” I trailed off as I waited for Ditto to transform.
"Oh!" Kayla exclaimed, "it's that transforming pokemon! You're that girl that Mary caught first!"
I resisted the urge to point out that this revelation probably shouldn't have been surprising, given that we'd just spent ten minutes watching me bumble around their greenhouse in glorious security-cam-o-vision.
Mary leaned forward, professional curiosity temporarily overtaking her suspicion. "It can transform into humans too? Can it speak?"
"Ditto?" Ditto answered in a voice that sounded like someone had run their voice through a helium filter.
"Haha, guess not," Marry chuckled.
"We should get a picture of this," Kayla said, watching Ditto maintain its eerily accurate physical imitation. "Though..." She glanced around the security room. "We don’t really have a camera here."
"The public relations office might have a camera," Mary offered, already rising from her chair. 
Before she could take more than a step though, the door opened, and everyone in the room straightened like we'd all been hit with Stun Store. Even Ditto, still wearing the thief's face, managed to look more formal somehow - though the effect was somewhat ruined by its attempted bow nearly sending it stumbling into a monitor.
A girl stood in the doorway, and my brain took several seconds to process what I was seeing. Not because she was particularly imposing, but because seeing Erika—the Erika—in person was like watching a sprite step out of my old Game Boy and decide to join reality. Years of pixel sprites and anime frames hadn't prepared me for how she actually existed in three-dimensional space, how her kimono created patterns that would have taken weeks to animate.
She wore a traditional kimono in soft yellow with delicate blue Pokeball patterns, the fabric somehow pristine despite the stuffy security office that had turned the rest of us into disheveled messes. Her dark hair was held back with simple wooden ornaments carved with flower motifs, and even in this glorified closet of a security room, she carried herself with the quiet dignity of someone more accustomed to tending her garden than dealing with petty thieves. The space was barely big enough for the security desk and chairs, forcing everyone to stand awkwardly close together, yet she managed to make even this cramped office feel like an extension of a grand greenhouse.
Mary and Kayla bowed respectfully. I followed a beat late, managing to crack my head against the back of my chair hard enough that the sound could have woken a Snorlax. So much for dignity.
Erika laughed—not the polite gym leader laugh I'd imagined, but something warmer and more genuine. She crossed the room and actually patted my head, which was surreal enough to momentarily short-circuit my brain. "Oh please, none of that," she said, waving off the formality. Her eyes crinkled with genuine amusement as she looked down at me.
I tried not to stare too obviously as she turned her attention to Mary's report, but it was hard not to notice the details games could never capture—the faint herbal scent that followed her movements, the soft rustle of her kimono, the quiet authority that made even Ditto straighten its borrowed spine.
The formality melted away surprisingly fast after that. Here in the cramped security office, with no crowds or ceremonies, Erika felt less like an imposing Gym Leader and more like someone's capable older sister who just happened to run one of Kanto's most prestigious facilities. She perched on the edge of the desk while Mary walked her through the security footage, occasionally glancing my way with a smile.
"So this is our thief?" Erika asked, studying Ditto's transformation with the kind of analytical interest I usually reserved for shiny Pokemon encounters.
"Yes, though we still need to get a photo to document it," Mary explained. "I was just going—"
"Before you fetch the camera," Erika interrupted, her casual tone suddenly sharpening, "I should share a theory I was just thinking of. The spores from Oddish are known to be a key ingredient in HP UP formula. Someone might have stolen it to try and reverse engineer our recipe."
Kayla frowned, pushing her glasses up in what I was starting to recognize as her 'actually...' gesture. "But... that's not the Pokemon we use for HP UP production anymore. Oddish isn't even—"
She caught herself mid-sentence, face flushing as she registered what she'd nearly revealed. Erika's smile remained perfectly in place, but her eyes had gone sharp as razors as she glanced briefly at me. The silence stretched just a beat too long before she spoke.
"I know," Erika nodded, and I had the distinct feeling I was watching a conversation happening on two different levels. "Which suggests either they got the wrong Oddish, or they didn't know and grabbed any Oddish they could find." She paused, tapping one finger against the desk. "We should check the item shops, see if anyone's selling unauthorized HP UP—or better yet, have the shops keep us updated on any information about new HP UP formulas." Her eyes gleamed with sudden purpose. "Mary, could you grab a camera from the PR office? We'll need to document everything properly. This could be the opportunity I need to advance my claim."
As Mary hurried off, I watched Ditto maintain its transformation, wondering if we were really about to crack open some corporate espionage plot.
Mary quickly returned with the camera, and we officially began planning our investigation of Celadon's Great Oddish Heist.
</Chapter>

<Chapter title="[Chapter 9] Side Quest: Trade Secrets" file="story/chapter9.txt">
Kayla had dozed off twice during our planning session, her chin dipping toward her chest in that slow-motion surrender every college student learns before their first 8 AM midterm. When Erika finally took pity and dismissed her, the girl's zombie shuffle toward the exit hit a snag halfway through the doorway - her entire body convulsed by a yawn so apocalyptic I half-expected to see her tonsils wave a white flag.
Moments after Kayla's departure, Erika's hip erupted in a sound somewhere between a distressed Magnemite and a fax machine having an existential crisis. She produced what I first thought was a Pokédex that had spent quality time in a Fearow's nest—all scratched plastic and yellowed buttons worn smooth by years of frustrated gym leader prodding.
Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Mary's slight forward lean, the way her fingers twitched against the manila folder—a trainer's instinct to answer the call of battle. But Erika's next words froze that motion mid-twitch.
"Mary," Erika's voice held a gentle reminder rather than a rebuke. "You know you're still suspended until further notice." She paused, her next words carefully chosen. "Though I suspect solving our Oddish predicament might help your case with the board." She smiled a knowing smile. "Keep me updated—and Mary, make sure our young friend here doesn't get into any more restricted areas?"
The rhythmic clack of wooden geta against polished floors faded down the hallway, leaving behind the lingering scent of greenhouse flowers and the weight of Mary's unspoken frustration. 
"Well," Mary said, attacking the printed photos with perhaps more vigor than necessary as she stuffed them into the manila folder. Her gaze drifted to one of the security monitors where trainers gathered for the afternoon's challenges, lingering just long enough to betray her longing. With visible effort, she dragged her attention back to our task. "Okay. Item shops."
\[^.^]/
The Celadon Department Store had been my first digital pilgrimage in every playthrough. Five floors of pixelated paradise where I'd bankrupt a thousand fictional selves for TMs and evolution stones. Now, standing before its real-world counterpart—all concrete and weathered signage instead of clean pixel art—I fought the absurd urge to check my nonexistent pockets for cheat codes.
The automatic doors hissed like a disapproving librarian, freezing me in the threshold. Air conditioning slapped my face, carrying the citrus tang of cleaning chemicals and something earthier beneath—crushed herbs? Burnt ozone? My nose twitched. 
Through the glass, reality flickered between my memories of American malls—all sleek escalators and standardized displays—and this fever dream of retail. A Mr. Mime in pressed black slacks pantomimed a traffic director's role with Broadway flair, its invisible walls parting the human and Pokémon streams like Moses at the retail sea. A Delibird waddled past dragging a returns cart twice its size, tail-bag gaping like Santa's sack after a bender. Somewhere to my left, a child wailed about their Growlithe eating a Poké Doll.
"First time?" Mary asked, catching my wide-eyed stare at... everything. “Let’s just say you’re not the first farm kid I’ve seen go cross-eyed at the size. Locals go nose-blind to this circus by week two.”
"I've seen bigger," I muttered, immediately regretting the reflex comparison as we joined the elevator queue. 
“Bigger than Celadon’s crown jewel?” Mary’s voice dripped with mock horror.
Ahead, a woman in a fur-trimmed coat that screamed 'old money' carried a Meowth in what looked to be an expensive designer bag. The Pokemon peered from its leather throne, gold coin glinting as it dragged a claw across its throat—directly at me. My stomach dropped. 'Does it know? Can it smell the dimensional stink on me, like some kind of cosmic TSA agent?'
The Meowth swiveled and repeated the gesture to a passing couple arguing over a map. The man yelped, fumbling the paper as his partner giggled.
Oh. It’s just an asshole.’ Relief flooded my veins like a cheap potion antidote.
I caught Mary's eyebrow creeping upward as she watched me. 'Think rural. Think boring. Think—'
"—It's okay," she cut in, merciful as a Chansey and twice as smug. "Not everyone can handle civilization."
Relief and irritation tangled in my chest—grateful for the easy escape from further questions, annoyed at being dismissed as some backwater yokel. Though to be fair, before the whole interdimensional bus incident, my biggest retail experiences had only been during vacations.
The elevator dinged, brass gates parting to reveal a Machop in pressed bellhop whites, its hands poised over an ornate lever where simple buttons should have been.
"Fifth floor," Mary said with practiced politeness, then added for my benefit, "Vitamins, along with HP UP, are up there, between 'Celadon Couture' and 'Trainer's Trophy Room.'"
The fur-coat woman barely glanced at the Machop, rings glinting like a chandelier in a mausoleum as she declared: "Four."
We settled into that universal elevator silence. The Machop's reflection flickered between focus and quiet despair as it guided us upward, while the Meowth maintained unblinking eye contact with me through the mirrored walls.
Clunk. Fourth floor. The Machop wrestled the cab into alignment, sweat beading on its brow. Fur-coat swept out, her Meowth pausing for one final throat-slitting gesture before the doors closed on its smug whisker-twitch.
The final ascent felt lighter in both weight and existential elevator dread. Even the Machop relaxed, claws tapping a jaunty rhythm against brass. 
The elevator deposited us into what my brain insisted on categorizing as 'Pokémon Nordstrom meets REI'. Racks of performance wear stretched into the distance—moisture-wicking fabrics in every shade of 'serious trainer', interspersed with displays of what looked suspiciously like designer battle accessories. A Furret in a staff vest methodically reorganized a tower of folded quick-dry shirts, its long body wrapping around the display like a living level.
"Battle Collection's in the back," Mary said, navigating us through the fashion maze.
The atmosphere shifted as we crossed some invisible retail border. The hum of browsing shoppers faded, replaced by the quiet reverence of serious spending. Evolution stones glowed like captured sunsets behind reinforced glass, while rows of technical machines pulsed with contained power. The vitamin display commanded its own alcove, arranged with the precision of a museum exhibit.
"Good morning," Mary approached the counter, her gym uniform transforming this from shopping trip to official inquiry. "Could you tell us about your current stock of vitamins?"
While Mary handled the official inquiry, I drifted toward the vitamin displays like a moth to particularly expensive flames. The bottles stood in perfect formation, their certification seals catching the light—and their price tags catching my breath. ₽9,800 or $98 for a single small HP UP bottle of vitamins. The larger ones... I did some quick mental math and decided I didn't need that kind of existential crisis today.
Each HP UP bore Celadon's Rainbow Badge seal like a designer logo, their green caps marking them as distinctly as a Gucci pattern. CALCIUM and IRON shared Pewter's Boulder Badge with their orange and yellow caps, carrying similarly painful price tags. PROTEIN, ZINC, and CARBOS bore unfamiliar badges I'd never seen rendered in pixel form, but their prices suggested they came from equally prestigious gyms.
It was surreal seeing them as actual products instead of menu items. No simple "+1 to stats" here—just rows of identical bottles with gym seals and colored caps, not a single ingredient list or warning label in sight. The lack of fine print was almost unsettling after a lifetime of pharmaceutical novels compressed onto tiny bottles. I caught myself wondering if they'd work on humans before my brain helpfully reminded me that drinking mystery Pokemon supplements was probably a fantastic way to discover exactly why they kept those formulations secret—assuming I survived the experiment.
"—sourced exclusively from Celadon Gym, of course," the clerk's voice filtered back into focus. "Regular shipments twice a week, fully stocked at present."
Mary nodded. "And you haven't noticed anything unusual about supply or demand recently? Any new vendors trying to sell similar products?"
"No, everything's been quite normal." The clerk responded with a tilted head.
"Anything unusual about HP UP in particular?" Mary pressed, her voice carefully casual.
The clerk adjusted her glasses, the pause stretching just long enough to be interesting. "Well... had someone asking questions last week. Young girl, kind of sickly-looking. Wanted to know if there was a cheaper option." She turned back to her ledger with the practiced disinterest of retail nobility. "I told her what everyone gets told—Celadon Gym keeps their secrets. Not my job to explain why."
"Did she mention why she was asking?" Mary's tone stayed light, but I caught the predatory focus underneath—like a Meowth pretending it wasn't stalking a Pidgey.
"Didn't care enough to ask." The clerk's pen scratched against paper with quiet finality. "She wasn't exactly waving around ₽10,000 per bottle money, if you catch my meaning. Why? Something happen?"
Mary shook her head. "Just following up on some inquiries. Please let the gym know if any new HP UP formulas come to market. Thank you for your time."
We drifted away from the counter, past those rows of mysterious bottles with their pristine Rainbow Badge seals. Each one probably contained enough carefully guarded secrets to give a pharmaceutical chemist a lifetime of dreams—or nightmares.
The complete lack of ingredient lists or warning labels made me wonder if there even was a Pokemon-world FDA, or if gym leaders just sat around in secret meetings deciding which concoctions to bless with their badges. 
'Please consult your local gym leader if side effects include spontaneous evolution...'
"Strange to ask about formulas openly if they were planning something," Mary muttered, more to herself than me. "Unless that was meant to be a distraction..."
“Something’s not quite adding up…” I muttered under my breath.
Mary caught my words and nodded slowly. "Yeah... this feels off." She gestured across the floor. "There's an herbal medicine shop over there as well. If someone's trying to recreate HP UP, they might've been asking questions there too."
-[?.?]-
The afternoon sun beat down mercilessly as we trudged out of our eighth—or was it ninth?—shop. My hands trembled slightly, and not just from exhaustion. Mary shot me another worried glance.
"I told you the coffee was a bad idea," she muttered, steadying me as I practically bounced off a street sign. Earlier, she'd tried to convince me to stick with juice, but I'd insisted I could handle it. After all, I'd been a coffee addict in my past life.
Unfortunately, my current body seemed to have very different opinions about caffeine. Every color felt too bright, every sound too sharp, and my thoughts raced faster than a Quick Attack.
"I'm fine!" I chirped, then immediately proved myself wrong by walking into a potted plant. "Totally fine. Super fine. Never been better. Did you know your hair looks like spaghetti when it moves? Wait, no, focus. Oddish. We're looking for Oddish."
Four more shops in the department store and two specialty herbalists later, the coffee had finally worn off enough for coherent thought. Each stop had added another piece to our puzzle: a desperate-looking girl, red-rimmed eyes, asking questions about HP UP production. The pattern was clear, but it led nowhere.
"That's most of the major item shops and herbalists in the shopping district," Mary said, studying a paper map that looked like it had survived several wars with various beverage spills. She traced a finger along a series of narrow lines, then frowned. "Same girl at all of them… There's a few more places that we should check behind the Game Corner, but..." She glanced at me with the kind of worried look adults always seemed to default to around children. "Maybe I should check those alone."
Internally, I wrestled with the urge to explain that I wasn't actually an ten-year-old who needed protecting. But explaining that would involve a story about reincarnation-via-truck that even I still had trouble believing. Instead, I just asked, "Because I look like a kid?"
"It's not exactly the safest area," Mary said diplomatically, which I translated as 'Yes, exactly because you're a kid.' "The Game Corner district tends to attract a... different crowd."
I tried not to visibly react to the mention of the Game Corner. In the games, it had always been Team Rocket's not-so-secret base of operations, complete with a hidden switch behind a poster. The reality was probably less cartoonishly villainous, but my caffeine-addled brain couldn't help conjuring images of shifty-eyed grunts and convenient trap doors. "I'll be careful. Besides, Ditto's with us."
Mary's frown deepened. "That's exactly what worries me. A child with a rare Pokémon walking into..." She shook her head. "Look, there are people there who might get... interested in a Ditto. I just don't want to endanger you." Her eyes darted to the minimized Pokeball in my hand, then back to me. "Even with my Bellsprout, it's not somewhere I should be taking someone your age."
The caffeine buzz in my system chose that moment to send another wave of jitters through my limbs. I tried passing it off as childish eagerness, bouncing on my toes while my thoughts raced in circles. Here I was, getting the 'you're too young' speech from someone who was younger than I'd been when I... when truck-kun had sent me here. The irony would have been hilarious if it wasn't so frustrating.
"If you leave me here, I'll probably just follow you anyway." The words came out before I could stop them, riding that wave of coffee-fueled impulse. Not my most sophisticated argument, but it had the benefit of being true. Between the caffeine making me too wired to sit still and the mystery making me too invested to back down, there was no way I was staying put.
Mary stared at me for a long moment, the kind of stare that made me wonder if she'd developed mind-reading abilities. Finally, she pinched the bridge of her nose. "You're not going to make this easy, are you?"
I tried to look innocent, which was probably undermined by another caffeine-induced bounce.
"Fine," she said, in the tone of someone already regretting their decision. "But you stay next to me the entire time. No wandering off, no talking to strangers.”
I nodded with what I hoped was appropriate childlike solemnity, though the next coffee-fueled bounce probably ruined the effect. Mary's rules were reasonable, very reasonable; something I would've done regardless.
The casino district turned out to be an assault on the senses that made my coffee jitters feel right at home. Neon competed with the afternoon sun in layers of electric poetry. "LIVE POKEMON SHOWS!" "WORLD-FAMOUS DANCERS!" "FORTUNE AWAITS!" Signs crawled up buildings like luminous vines, each promising something more spectacular than the last.
The wide boulevards pulsed with energy as promoters in flashy uniforms tried to lure people into their establishments, their practiced pitches mixing with the electronic chimes of countless games and machines spilling from the open doors of the Game Corner. "Free drinks for trainers!" "Best odds in Kanto!" "Pokemon dance review starts in twenty minutes!"
Meowth patrolled in pairs, coins gleaming like badges as they wove between the legs of the crowd, keeping a watchful eye for troublemakers while adding to the district's aura of prosperity.
Trainers stumbled with glassy-eyed determination between the Game Corner and the pawn shops, their pockets lighter with each trip but their dreams of hitting the jackpot growing heavier. Some clutched Meowth-shaped tokens or muttered slot combinations under their breath like mantras, caught in the endless cycle of "just one more spin."
"Watch your step," Mary warned as we navigated around a Grimer that had made itself comfortable in the middle of the street, seemingly unbothered by the constant flow of foot traffic splitting around it like a stream. "And try not to stare at anyone too long."
I nodded, fighting the urge to bounce on my toes. The coffee might have worn off enough for coherent thought, but my body still hummed with excess energy. Every storefront seemed to hold another wonder, every alley another mystery. The reality of being a child-sized caffeinated detective was significantly more electrifying than I'd anticipated.
Shop number twelve looked like it had been squeezed between its neighbors as an afterthought. Before Mary could reach for the door, voices drifted through the thin walls.
"—can't believe you actually did it," the man's voice, somewhere between awe and horror. "You actually stole a pokemon from the gym?"
"You said Oddish was the key ingredient," a girl's voice, followed by a sneeze and a huge sniffle, "That if I had the gym’s Oddish’s spores he might—"
"Yeah, it is. But its not like I know how to make HP UP. I’m not an apothecary, I’m a shopkeeper. I just sell the stuff. You know you're gonna get years in prison. And for what? You should’ve worked up and saved the money to buy it. Hell, even stealing HP UP directly would’ve—"
Another sneeze interrupted him. "Please. My brother, he's—"
Before I could process what was happening, Mary shouldered past me and threw open the shop door. The bell's discordant chime made both occupants jump. My heart did a caffeine-enhanced somersault as I stumbled in after her.
The shop was doing brisk business, exactly what you'd expect from a place near the Game Corner. Glass cases displayed genuine TMs at tourist-trap prices, while shelves held rows of properly labeled potions and supplements. The whole place smelled like artificial berry scent, probably pumped through the ventilation system just like the casinos did with their signature fragrances. 
For one frozen moment, we all stared at each other. Then the girl's eyes darted to the curtained back room, the shopkeeper's face went from nervous to terrified, and my caffeine-addled brain helpfully supplied that this was about to become a very different kind of afternoon.
The girl bolted for the curtained doorway, golden spores trailing in her wake like some sort of sparkly breadcrumb trail. My coffee-addled brain helpfully supplied that this would be the part of a game where dramatic pursuit music would kick in. Reality was less orchestrated but way more chaotic—though being small finally had its advantages.
While Mary got tangled up with a precariously balanced display of evolution stones, I slipped through the narrow spaces between shelves like a Rattata in a maze. The back room opened into an alley that definitely wasn't on any official map of Celadon, real or game.
My legs pumped faster than they ever had in this small body, but physics was physics—the girl ahead might have been wheezing and sneezing with every step, spores glittering in her wake like some twisted version of Tinker Bell, but she still had twice my stride length. Each time I thought I was gaining ground, another sneeze would propel her forward in a panic, leaving me chasing golden sparkles and crushing realizations about the limitations of being child-sized.
In a moment of gaming-logic brilliance that reality promptly crushed, I fumbled for Ditto's ball. "Get her!" 
Ditto materialized in a flash of red light, and for a split second, I felt like a proper trainer.
Then Ditto bounced forward in what I generously assumed was meant to be a Tackle, only to hit the cobblestones with all the impact of a thrown marshmallow. The girl didn't even break stride—just sneezed again and rounded another corner, leaving Ditto and me to share a moment of profound disappointment in our battle debut.
Then Mary's voice rang out behind me. "Bellsprout, trip her up!"
“Bell!” A flash of green shot past me as Bellsprout's vine coiled around the girl's ankle with elegant precision. She went down in a tangle of limbs and sneezes, the cloth bag tumbling from her grasp. Golden spores drifted through the air like pixelated status effects come to life.
"No!" she cried, face pressed against the cobblestones.
Mary knelt beside the girl, her voice gentle but firm. "Oddish. Where is it?"
The girl's response came in a rush of tears and panic, snot mixing with the golden spores still clinging to her face. "Please don't send me to jail! Please! My brother needs me! He'll die if I don't help him!"
</Chapter>

<Chapter title="[Chapter 10] Side Quest: Complete!" file="story/chapter10.txt">
The girl on the ground continued to sob, each heaving breath sending fresh waves of spores spinning into the afternoon light. My nose itched in sympathy. The caffeine buzz that had powered my chase was starting to crash, leaving me with shaky legs and the dawning realization that we'd run much deeper into the alternative business district than I'd thought. The neon signs above buzzed more intermittently here, their promises of miracle cures feeling more desperate than enticing.
"Your brother?" Mary's voice remained steady, though her grip on my shoulder tightened slightly. "Tell us about him."
"He's—" Another sneeze interrupted her explanation, and I watched as Mary instinctively moved to help her sit up. "He's only six, and the hospital said—" She broke off, wiping her nose with her sleeve. "They said they couldn't do anything without proper registration, but we don't have—we can't—"
Healthcare. Right. In all my hours of playing Pokemon, healing had just been a cheerful jingle at a Pokemon Center. I'd never thought about human hospitals here, or if they were as nightmarish about insurance as back in my world.
"Take us to Oddish," Mary said, her voice carrying a note of authority. When the girl looked up in confusion, Mary added, "Take us to your Oddish, and your brother. Maybe we can help."
The girl's eyes darted between us, and then to her fallen bag. "You won't... you're not going to report me?"
I stepped forward, suddenly very aware of how the oversized dress Dr. Fuji insisted I wear made me look even smaller than I was. "We want to understand. That's all."
Kaede's red-rimmed eyes flickered to me for just a moment before sneezing and dismissing me entirely—the way you do with NPCs that aren't part of the current quest.
"I'm Kaede," she said, pushing herself to her feet. Another sneeze nearly sent her back down, but Mary caught her arm. "He's... he's still at my apartment."
As we followed Kaede deeper into the district, the electronic pulse of the Game Corner faded behind us. The neon became more sporadic, creating patches of shadow that seemed to breathe in the afternoon light. A Meowth watched us pass from atop a dumpster, but this one wasn't wearing the practiced swagger of the patrol pairs we'd seen earlier. Its ribs showed through matted fur, and its coin looked dull, almost tarnished.
The mechanical drone of industrial fans began to fill the air, along with other sounds I couldn't quite identify. A cry echoed from somewhere above—maybe a Pokemon, maybe just the wind through the increasingly decrepit buildings.
Either way, it made me walk a little closer to Mary, my fingers absently finding Ditto's pokeball and settling over the release button. I was grateful for Mary’s steady presence and the watchful Bellsprout that moved silently alongside us.
The neon grew sicker the deeper we went, bleeding into puddles of color that reflected off grimy windows and collected in the corners of weathered concrete. Signs that had promised "MIRACLE CURES!" and "INSTANT HEALING!" gave way to bare wires and empty frames, their desperate promises fading into the growing shadows of late afternoon.
Kaede led us down a narrow passage between buildings, ducking under a web of power lines that hummed with angry electricity. A Grimer oozed past an overflowing dumpster, its amorphous body glistening sickly in the fading light. In the games, they'd always been these cute purple blobs with googly eyes—the kind of monster you could almost imagine hugging if you ignored the poison typing. The real thing was... well, let's just say there was a reason they thrived in urban decay, and it had nothing to do with being huggable.
"It's just up here," Kaede mumbled between sniffles, gesturing to a concrete building that looked like it had been designed by someone who really hated windows. "Third floor."
The stairwell smell hit me like a physical force—a mix of mildew and something chemical that made my eyes water. Each step echoed off bare walls, creating a chorus of footfalls that seemed to mock how small we were in this space. Mary's Bellsprout wrapped one vine around the rusted railing as we climbed, like even it didn't trust the structural integrity of this place.
I found myself counting steps, mapping out escape routes like I used to plan dungeon crawls. Three flights up, two back down, factor in child-sized legs and likely encounter zones... The gaming habits were probably ridiculous, but they were keeping the panic at bay. My thumb hadn't left Ditto's pokeball button since we'd entered the building, and right now I'd take whatever coping mechanisms I could get.
Kaede fumbled with her keys at a door that had definitely seen better decades, probably back when Kanto was still considering color TV. Each clank of metal against metal echoed through the hallway like a countdown, making my fingers twitch against Ditto's pokeball. The caffeine crash was hitting hard now, leaving me with the kind of headache that made me wonder if those "MIRACLE CURES!" shops from before could help.
The lock finally surrendered with a sound like grinding teeth, and the door creaked open to reveal... well, calling it an apartment felt generous. It was more like someone had taken the concept of "indoor space" and compressed it until only the bare essentials remained. A mattress occupied one corner, while a hot plate balanced precariously on a stack of milk crates served as the kitchen. The window—singular—was partially covered by cardboard, creating strips of late afternoon light that cut through the air like search beams.
An Oddish sat in the room's center, releasing gentle puffs of spores over a small figure huddled under a thin blanket. Each sparkle of golden dust made Kaede sneeze, but she moved forward anyway, kneeling beside what I now realized was her brother.
The boy's breathing came in shallow waves, each exhale sending ripples through the golden spores that Oddish kept carefully releasing. Up close, I could see the sheen of sweat on his forehead, the way his fingers twitched restlessly against the thin blanket.
Mary knelt beside the mattress, her expression shifting from trainer authority to something softer, more concerned. She studied the boy's face, then the cramped room with its cardboard-patched window and milk crate furniture. When she spoke, her voice was quiet but certain. "She's telling the truth."
Kaede's shoulders sagged with relief, though another sneeze quickly followed. "So you'll help? You won't take Oddish away?"
Mary glanced at the grass Pokemon, who had paused in its spore production to fix her with a surprisingly stern look. For a moment, they seemed to have a silent conversation—gym trainer and Pokemon, each weighing obligations against necessities. Finally, Mary sighed.
"Oddish," Mary said, "let’s return to the gym. Everyone’s been worried sick."
Kaede's shoulders slumped in helpless defeat, her previous desperation giving way to resignation. The faint wheezing from her brother Hiro seemed to echo in the tiny apartment.
“Od-Oddish!”, Oddish, however, shook its head, leaves swaying with determined refusal. It pointed one stubby foot at Hiro, then resumed its gentle spore release.
I watched Mary's face cycle through frustration, resignation, and finally determination. "Right," she said, pushing herself up. "Let’s go get Erika. She'll know what to do." 
She then turned to Kaede. "Stay here. Keep him comfortable. We'll be back as quick as we can."
We hurried down the creaking stairs, my shorter legs working double-time to keep up with Mary's pace. The caffeine crash was hitting hard now, but I pushed forward to keep my eyes open.
-[v.v]-
The next hour passed in fragments. I vaguely remember Mary paying for train tickets, and then suddenly we were moving, the gentle sway of the carriage finally defeating my caffeine-fueled stubbornness. My head drooped against the window, and for a precious few minutes, the world faded away entirely.
I woke to Mary gently shaking my shoulder, the afternoon sun casting long shadows through the train windows. We hurried through Celadon's streets, where the day's business was still in full swing but had taken on that particular energy that comes when people start thinking about closing time. My shorter legs worked double-time to keep up with Mary's determined pace.
The gym's ginkgo trees cast dappled shadows across the path, their leaves beginning to take on that golden late-afternoon glow. Instead of being stopped at the entrance, Mary led us straight through a side door I hadn't even noticed during my previous visits. A familiar greenhouse scents of soil and sweet grass filled my nose.
We wound through the now-familiar hallways of the gym. The sounds of battle echoed from multiple directions—a complex symphony of trainers calling moves, pokemon responding, and the constant background rustle of various grass-types moving through their natural environment.
Mary led us toward what seemed to be the main arena. It was divided in two by a large retractable wall, with many bleachers on each side, each somewhat filled with people. Two battles were running simultaneously, and I caught a glimpse of Erika directing a Weepinbell with a precision that made game commands like "Razor Leaf" seem absurdly simplistic. Mary paused at the edge of the window, her eyes tracking Weepinbell's movements with professional interest.
"We'll have to wait until she finishes with this challenger," Mary said, already moving toward a door marked 'Staff Only.' "It shouldn't be long."
My heart did a little skip at those words. A real life gym challenge... Not the simplified turn-based battles from the games, nor the dramatic anime-style matches I'd watched growing up.
The narrow corridor curved around the arena's edge, and as we emerged onto the bleachers on Erika's side, I could finally see my first real gym challenge battle.
Weepinbell moved with an almost dance-like grace, vines weaving patterns I'd never seen animated or described, while the challenger's Golbat darted through the air like a living shadow, each wingbeat so precise it made the hovering sprites or models from my games seem almost insulting in their simplicity.
Erika spared us a glance and a nod before quickly refocusing on her battle.
The grace of the initial exchanges suddenly shattered as the challenger called out: "Golbat, climb and dive! Wing Attack!"
With a piercing "SCREEE!", Golbat shot upward, nearly brushing the gym's high ceiling. 
Erika's eyes narrowed. "Stun Spore, wide dispersion!" she commanded. Weepinbell's bell-shaped body pulsed, releasing a glittering cloud that began spreading through the air.
"Stop! Split the cloud! Gust!" The trainer quickly reacted. Golbat's wings snapped wide, arresting its dive with shocking precision. With a harsh "SCREEE!", it began beating its wings powerfully, creating violent air currents that tore the spore cloud apart before it could settle.
"Wrap and Acid!" Erika called. Weepinbell's vines shot out like lightning, but Golbat was already banking hard, its wingspan allowing for tight turns that kept it just out of reach. A spray of Acid splashed harmlessly against the wall.
"Acid spray, full coverage!" Erika commanded sharply, but Weepinbell was still shaking off the Screech's effects. Its spray went wide, and in that split second of disorientation, Golbat struck again, wings flashing. This time its attack connected solidly.
Weepinbell let out a pained "BEEEELL!" as it tumbled backward. Though it righted itself quickly with its vines, I could see the battle was turning.
"Circle around for Wing Attack!" The challenger pressed their advantage, their Golbat's wings cutting sharp crescents through the humid greenhouse air.
Erika didn't flinch. She watched, perfectly still, as the bat Pokémon banked into position. Three heartbeats passed. Then—
“Wrap, then slam!" 
Weepinbell's vines shot out like striking Ekans, snaring Golbat mid-dive. The poison-type didn't resist - instead, it used the bat's own momentum, redirecting that speed into a whiplashing arc that ended with a thunderous crash against the arena floor. Golbat's pained "SCREE!" echoed off the glass walls.
"Break free with Bite!" Golbat's fangs clamped onto the vine, causing Weepinbell to release its grip with a sharp “WEE!”. The bat launched skyward again, wobbling slightly.
"Sleep Powder, straight up!" A dense cloud bloomed directly in Golbat's path.
"Bank left, then Leech Life!" Golbat wheeled away from the powder, its fangs glowing as it dove. The strike connected, draining some of Weepinbell's remaining energy while restoring its own.
Erika's eyes flashed. "Vine trap and Acid!" Two vines shot out, crossing to form an X. For a moment, Golbat was caught in the intersection—just long enough for a direct hit with Acid.
But the challenger had been waiting for Weepinbell to commit. "Endure and supersonic!"
Despite its burned wings, Golbat’s resistance to poison let it hold firm in the vine trap and unleashed waves of disorienting energy at point-blank range. Weepinbell swayed, its vines going slack as confusion set in.
"Shake it off! Get back!" Erika called, but Weepinbell's vines whipped wildly, striking itself in its confused state.
"Now, Wing Attack!" As Weepinbell reeled from its self-inflicted hit, Golbat powered through its pain for one final strike. The impact sent Weepinbell spinning across the floor. This time, it didn't get back up, it’s eyes swirling.
"Weepinbell is unable to battle!" the referee announced.
Two gym trainers quickly moved onto the field to carefully lift the unconscious Weepinbell onto a stretcher. I frowned slightly, wondering why Erika didn't just use a Pokeball to return it.
But my attention was drawn to back to the battle as Erika released her Tangela. The challenger's Golbat was still airborne, but its wingbeats seeming labored after the hits, and its earlier exertions were starting to show. The challenger frowned as he studied their exhausted Pokémon.
"Final round!" the referee called, readying his flags. "Begin!"
"Tangela, Ingrain!" At Erika's command, Tangela let out a deep "TANG!" as a mass of vines burrowed into the arena floor, anchoring itself.
"Don't give it time—Golbat, Screech then Wing Attack!" The challenger pressed their advantage against the immobile target. Golbat's "SCREEEEEE!" made everyone wince as it dove toward Tangela.
"Stun Spore—blanket the air!" Erika's command cut through the fading echoes. Some of tangela's vines writhed in response, releasing a shimmering cloud of yellow-gold spores that filled the space between the combatants. The challenger's lips curved into a smile.
"Same as before—Gust!" the challenger called confidently. Golbat's wings spread wide, ready to disperse the spores.
But suddenly vines erupted from the floor behind Golbat, where they'd been quietly spreading during the Ingrain. The unexpected attack disrupted Golbat's wingbeats, forcing it through part of the spore cloud. Its wings stiffened instantly, sending it tumbling through the air.
"Now, Constrict into Giga Drain!" More vines shot out, wrapping around the paralyzed Golbat before it could recover. Green energy began flowing through the vines as Tangela drained its opponent's strength.
"Break free with Bite!" the challenger called desperately, but Golbat's paralyzed state made it too weak. As Tangela continued draining its energy, the bat's struggles grew weaker.
"Finish with Vine Whip!" Multiple vines lashed out simultaneously, striking Golbat from several angles. With a final weak "scree...", Golbat's eyes turned to swirls. Tangela's vines gently unwound, lowering the defeated Pokémon to the arena floor.
"Golbat is unable to battle! The winner is Gym Trainer Erika!"
‘Wait... gym trainer?’
The challenger rushed forward to check on their fallen Pokémon, cradling it gently. "You fought amazingly," they murmured as he helped to put it on the stretcher.
Erika nodded to her Tangela with a soft smile. "Thanks for the hard work." The Tangela responded with a happy "Tang!" before being returned to its pokeball in a flash of red light.
The tangela responded happily, before Erika brought her pokeball up to return it.
An attendant quickly appeared with a towel, which Erika accepted with a nod. As she wiped the sweat from her brow, her eyes met Mary's. Without a word, she gestured for us to follow, leading the way through a door marked "Staff."
"I thought Erika was the gym leader?" I whispered to Mary as we walked to join Erika.
Mary looked at me like I was an idiot. "She's way too young to be Gym Leader."
I didn't get the chance to follow up before we joined Erika in the Staff hallway.
"Tell me everything," Erika commanded as we walked, her battle-worn demeanor bleeding into her words. "That should be my last challenger for today, so we have time."
Mary quickly outlined what we'd found: Kaede's theft wasn't corporate espionage, but a desperate attempt to help her brother Hiro in the ‘Factory Ward.’ "The kid's really sick—fever or something. Our Oddish won't leave him."
Erika's stern expression shifted as Mary spoke. When she heard the symptoms, her eyes sharpened with recognition. "Sludge Fever," she said, her voice taking on a clinical tone. "It's been spreading through the Factory Ward again." She quickened her pace. "We need to move fast. The longer we wait with Sludge Fever..." She didn't finish the sentence.
I noticed how her earlier formality had completely vanished, replaced by focused urgency.
Erika paused as we passed the main arena again, watching a maintenance crew prepare it for tomorrow's matches. "It's a bit of a shame that it wasn't corporate espionage," she remarked to Mary. "The publicity would've been great for my future gym leader claim."
Mary nodded, understanding clear in her expression.
‘Ah, this was before Erika became gym leader. That made sense.’
Before we left the whole gym grounds, Erika made a brief detour to one of the smaller greenhouses, not the grand one I'd trespassed in earlier. She moved with practiced efficiency, stuffing various herbs and berries into a simple leather pouch. The scents mixed together—sharp, sweet, medicinal—creating something that reminded me of a traditional pharmacy. Even in her haste, she handled each plant with precise care.
We hurried through Celadon's crowded rush hour streets to catch the train. The setting sun painted long shadows between the buildings, and the factory district's smokestacks looked particularly ominous against the orange sky. The train car fell quiet as we entered an industrial sector, as if the very air grew heavier.
Through the window, I watched in growing unease as the bright signs of the shopping district faded away. I'd slept through this transition on our way out earlier, but the stark industrial landscape was like entering an entirely different city.
Even the few other passengers seemed to hunch their shoulders, as if trying to make themselves smaller in the thickening air.
-[v.v]-
The apartment's stairwell was even darker than I remembered, the bare concrete steps echoing with each step. Mary led the way, with Erika following close behind, her expression focused as she pulled various herbs and supplies from the leather bag.
When we entered the small room, the Oddish was still there, releasing waves of Sweet Scent over Hiro's thin mattress. The boy's breathing was labored, each inhale a concerning whistle. Kaede sat beside him, gripping his hand, her eyes red and puffy.
Erika didn't hesitate. She knelt beside Hiro, one hand checking his pulse while the other tested his forehead. Her movements reminded me of a veteran trainer checking a Pokemon's condition—quick, for sure, born from experience.
Kaede kept sneezing and rubbing at her reddened eyes. Between the stress and whatever was making her eyes water, she looked absolutely miserable. "I've been trying everything else for weeks," she managed, voice thick. "The Oddish... it helps him breathe better than anything else we tried."
She hadn't moved an inch from her brother's side, despite whatever was affecting her. I wondered if it was the industrial air in this part of town, or maybe the stress was just getting to her. Either way, her dedication was clear.
Mary's voice was gentle, but her question cut through the room like a knife: "Is this why you stole Oddish?"
Kaede sniffed up a thick glob of snot before looking down guiltily. With a soft whisper, she responded, “Yes… I thought I could make HP UP to extend his life…”
Mary's eyes widened. "That's not—" She caught herself, softening her tone. "HP UP doesn't work like that at all. It doesn’t really extend life. It's a supplement that helps Pokemon develop their natural durability over time. Using it on humans could be dangerous—our bodies aren't made to handle those kinds of compounds. It could make him even sicker. You have to buy proper human medicines."
Kaede's eyes widened in horror. She looked at the Oddish, then back at her brother. "I... I almost..."
"You were desperate," Erika cut in, not looking up from her work. Her hands moved swiftly, crushing leaves into a fine powder. "But now we can help properly. Mary, could you bring that mortar closer? And hold the vial steady—yes, just like that."
The mixture they created had a sharp, clean scent that cut through the industrial air. As Erika worked, I noticed Hiro's breathing becoming less labored, though Kaede's sneezing seemed to intensify.
"The Oddish can stay," Erika said, writing something on official-looking paperwork. "It's got good instincts. But you'll need to bring him to the gym's medical wing every other day for the next two weeks."
Erika paused, looking around the small room—taking in the thin mattress, the bare walls, the single window clouded by factory smoke. She sighed. "I assume you don't have insurance?"
Kaede shook her head, shoulders slumping.
Another sigh from Erika as she looked down at the crushed herbs in her mortar. For a moment, she seemed to be calculating something. Then her expression softened, just slightly. "It's free. The herbs grow in our greenhouse anyway." She tapped her pen against the paperwork before adding, "Just... don't mention this to anyone. The gym has procedures."
Relief flooded Kaede's face, even as another sneeze wracked her body. Through tears and snot, she thanked Erika, "Thank you. Thank you so much."
Mary began packing up the supplies, a small smile playing at her lips. I noticed she was careful to keep her face turned away from Erika, as if worried her approval might somehow make the gym trainer change her mind.
\[^.^]/
The evening train rattled through Celadon's entertainment district, neon signs flashing past the windows.
I let myself smile, the handful of coins from Mary—mostly spent on another day pass—warm in my palm. First quest reward earned in this world. First real adventure too and mostly finished with Celadon’s main places of interest.
My backpack sat heavy in my lap as the train rumbled beneath us, so different from just pressing buttons on a game console, but maybe better in its own way—
The train's brakes squealed at the Game Corner station. Through the window's neon-streaked glass stood Dr. Fuji, stark in his white coat.
Our eyes met through the scratched glass as the doors slid open with a pneumatic hiss.
My smile froze.
He stepped into the car of the train with careful, measured movements, his deep frown a stark contrast to the cheerful advertisements plastered on the walls.
He reached out a palm, “Ditto?”I hesitated, glancing around the train, noting only a single person sleeping to the side.
“Give me back Ditto,” Dr. Fuji repeated icily.
I hesitantly placed the minimized pokeball into his palm.
The moment the pokeball was placed into his hand, he pulled back and a stinging sensation filled my face as he slapped me.
Neither of us spoke as he sat in the empty seat next to me.
The train lurched forward, carrying us away from my brief taste of freedom. Away from the friends I’d just made in this new world.
I held the right side of my face as I looked through the window, watching the last traces of neon fade into industrial darkness as we entered a tunnel, flickering lights casting strange shadows across Dr. Fuji’s frown.

<Chapter title="[Chapter 11] Pallet Town" file="story/11.txt">
Today's dress hung on my closet door like a ghost. Plain white cotton instead of the usual frills and lace, with just a simple red ribbon at the neck. The sight of it made my stomach turn. After weeks of Dr. Fuji's obsession with making me wear elaborate dresses, this simple white one felt deliberate. Wrong. Like he was dressing me for a specific role, though I couldn't quite remember where I'd seen it before.
The apartment air pressed down, stale with unsaid things. Ditto stood by my door, a perfect mirror of that first day—before the mini-adventures, the battle, the taste of friendship in this world.
"Good morning?" I tried.
Silence. Just yesterday we'd celebrated my first reward, a handful of suddenly meaningless coins. Now Ditto just… watched. Back to being the proper guardian. A wall between us.
In the kitchen, wrongness piled up. Cold tea in a forgotten mug. An empty chair where Dr. Fuji should be. And there, the empty space by the kettle where Ditto's Pokeball used to sit, a glaring absence.
Would anyone notice I was gone? Mary, Kaede, Erika—our whirlwind adventure felt like a lifetime ago, but it had only been a day. We hadn't made concrete plans, but surely they'd wonder where I'd disappeared to. Wouldn't they?
I poked at soggy cereal, too aware of Ditto watching from the doorway. "So... about yesterday—"
Nothing. Not a ripple. Just that steady, neutral gaze that made my skin prickle. I forced down another sand-dry bite. Some reward. Trapped with a friend who couldn't be one anymore.
Watching Ditto's cold distance reminded me of another set of lost friends—the ones from my old life. 
My college friends were probably still reeling. No dramatic farewell, not even a proper game over screen—just me, a semi-truck, and that last desperate message about Shadow Mewtwo. Their final memory of me would be an empty dorm room and a string of "where are you?" texts that would never get answers.
The morning dragged on, an endless stretch of mindless channel surfing. Battle tournaments, contest highlights, documentaries on the migratory patterns of Beautifly... None of it could hold my interest. 
How could it, after the heart-pounding reality of my own battles? The rush of working in sync with Ditto, the pride of overcoming challenges together, the promise of a real bond—the TV offered only pale imitations. Just flashy spectacles without the personal stakes that had made my brief adventure feel so meaningful.
And through it all, Ditto watched me, still as a statue. No excited trills at the battles, no curious head tilts at the contests. Just that wary, too-knowing gaze. A silent reminder of how much had changed overnight.
The knock, when it finally came, shattered the suffocating silence. Dr. Fuji burst through the door, not waiting for a response. He'd shed his usual lab coat for a crisp brown vest over a neatly pressed button-down shirt. Despite the formal attire, there was something strange in his manner—a taut energy that made his usual composed demeanor feel like a mask about to slip.
"We're leaving." His voice had a strange, stretched quality I'd never heard before. Taut and thin, like a wire about to snap. "Flight leaves soon."
Without ceremony, he recalled Ditto. The Pokeball vanished into his pocket. Then his hand clamped around my wrist, hauling me out into the sudden bustle of the streets.
The Pidgeot Express field sprawled across what would have been prime Celadon real estate. No neat rows of houses here—just an expanse of trampled grass and wooden platforms where massive birds perched like living aircraft. 
The morning formation swooped overhead—seven Pidgeots cutting through dawn in perfect V-formation, each wingbeat sending visible ripples through the morning mist. A week ago, that sight had nearly brought me to tears. Now all I could think about was how each of those wings could generate hurricane-force winds with a single flap, how its razor-sharp beak could tear through flesh, and how the games never mentioned what happened to passengers who fell from the height of their flight.
Dr. Fuji pulled me through the barely-contained bedlam, his grip never loosening. "Looks like good weather at least," he remarked, but the lightness rang hollow. Forced. "Clear skies to Viridian."
Words lay fossilized on my tongue as he manhandled me into the harness, each buckle a tiny shackle. The liftoff ripped the air from my lungs, leaving my stomach far below.
I'd always imagined this—skimming through clouds, marveling at the bird's-eye view of the world below. But as Kanto smeared into a blur of color, a single morbid thought knocked around my skull: how many trainers had the unforgiving sky swallowed up, never to be seen again?
The question chased me long after we landed. Dr. Fuji hustled me through Viridian's winding streets, backtracking twice with a muttered curse. When he finally veered into a narrow alley, the car lot waiting at the end sent a fresh jolt of surprise through me.
Cars were a rarity in Celadon, and I'd barely spared them a glance, too caught up in the thrill of real Pokemon. But now, faced with the rusted husks slouching in this forgotten lot, I couldn't look away. They seemed to belong to another era entirely, all boxy frames and chrome grills as if from the 1950s.
After Dr. Fuji paid for a day’s rental, he yanked open the passenger door and ordered, “Get in.”
I eyed the cracked leather seats and the dust-filmed dashboard, wondering if this was some kind of elaborate prank. But Dr. Fuji's expression held no hint of humor as he drummed his fingers against the roof, his whole body coiled with barely suppressed agitation.
Swallowing my questions, I clambered into the passenger seat, wincing as the ancient springs dug into my back.
As the city gave way to rolling hills and dense forests, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were driving straight into the past. The car's radio dial was frozen on a station that crackled out staticky old jazz tunes, and every bump in the road rattled the frame like it was one pothole away from shaking apart entirely.
The southern road wound through rolling countryside, each hill revealing more of the landscape ahead. A laboratory complex appeared long before the town itself—a sprawling collection of windmills and research buildings perched atop the highest hill like something from a Studio Ghibli film. The setting sun painted the spinning blades in shades of amber and gold, their long shadows sweeping across the valley below like the hands of some giant clock counting down to... Pallet Town?
With its proximity to Viridian City and the iconic windmills of Professor Oak’s lab seemingly pulled from the cartoons, this was clearly Pallet Town.
My hands twisted in my lap as questions I'd been avoiding crashed through my mind: Why Pallet Town? Was this even the same timeline as the games? Or was it the anime? …Manga? Did Ash exist here? Red? Both? Neither?
 The reality of this world kept diverging further from everything I thought I knew, and each difference felt like another crack in whatever remained of my certainty.
The Town emerged gradually: first scattered farms, then clusters of houses, and finally the town proper. It was smaller than I'd imagined, barely more than a collection of homes wrapped around the base of Oak's lab’s hill.
We turned onto a narrow lane lined with neat gardens. A woman worked among the flower beds, and for a moment I didn't recognize her. But her auburn hair, pink dress and dirt-stained apron, along with being in pallet town—this was obviously Delia Ketchum.
The car's brakes squealed. Before I could process the scene, Dr. Fuji's hand found my arm, pulling me from the car. Gravel crunched under my feet as I stumbled.
In the yard, a dark-haired boy played with a Poliwag, his laughter carrying in the evening air. I froze—I knew that face from countless episodes, but seeing Ash Ketchum as a young child felt wrong.
Or... was this Red? The Poliwag made me doubt everything I thought I knew. The manga version had a Poliwag, didn't he? But that was definitely Delia in the garden, so this had to be Ash. Unless this was some weird timeline where—
A twig snapped under Dr. Fuji's shoe. The woman turned, brushing hair from her face with soil-stained fingers. For a moment, her expression was simply curious. Then her eyes found Dr. Fuji, and recognition crawled across her face like an advancing shadow.
"Delia." Dr. Fuji's voice cracked on the name like thin ice. "It's... it's been a while."
I watched the woman at the garden freeze, trowel suspended mid-motion. This was Delia—Ash Ketchum's mother—but something was wrong. In all my hours of Pokemon games and shows, I'd never heard of any connection between her and Dr. Fuji. The garden tool trembled in her grip, dark soil falling like black snow.
Even the boy and his Poliwag had gone quiet, sensing the shift in atmosphere.
"I brought—" He pushed me forward like a prize specimen. "I brought her back. I did it, Delia. I brought our daughter back."
The garden tools lay forgotten among the flowers, their shadows stretching long across the carefully tended earth. In the dying light, I watched Delia's face go completely still, as if she'd forgotten how to breathe. Her eyes fixed on me with an expression I couldn't read—something between disbelief and dawning horror.
"You actually did it," she whispered, and there was something terrible in her voice, like she was seeing every fear she'd ever had come true at once. "After all these years, you actually—"
The sound of running water cut off abruptly inside. A chair scraped against wood, followed by the bang of a screen door. A man burst onto the porch, sleeves rolled up and hands still dripping soap suds.
The boy—Ash? Red?—snapped out of his frozen state, the tension sliding right off him. "Dad! Come look at what Poliwag learned today!"
His father's eyes never left us as he descended the worn wooden steps of the porch, each creak underlining the tension. Even with soap suds still clinging to his arms, there was nothing domestic about his expression as he watched these uninvited ghosts invade his dooryard.
Twenty years of anime episodes where he simply didn't exist, and here he was washing dishes. Something about that felt more wrong than right.
The Poliwag splashed in a puddle, oblivious to the growing storm. Delia's voice cut through the evening air, quiet but firm: "Ash, take Poliwag inside."
"But Mom—"
"Now, please."
I watched him hesitate, caught in that peculiar childhood moment of sensing adult tension without understanding its source. After what felt like forever, he scooped up his Poliwag and trudged toward the house, trailing water with each step.
"Who are you?" Ash's father moved to stand beside his wife, positioning himself between us and the house. Water dripped steadily from his rolled sleeves onto the freshly turned earth.
Dr. Fuji's fingers dug deeper into my shoulder. "This doesn't concern you." His voice had taken on a strange, dreamy quality that made my skin crawl. "You've played your part, offering comfort while I was away. But now I've succeeded. Our daughter—" he pushed me forward again, "—is back. We can be a proper family again. A brilliant family. Not this..." he gestured at the modest blue house, the neat rows of flowers, "...pastoral mediocrity."
The garden tools lay scattered where Delia had dropped them, their metal surfaces catching the last rays of sunlight. She stood very still, and I wondered if this was how she'd looked when Dr. Fuji first told her about his plans to clone their daughter—that perfect balance between fury and heartbreak.
"Pastoral mediocrity?" Her voice trembled with the weight of years. "While you were hiding in your lab trying to play god, I built something real. Something whole." She swept her arm toward the cheerful blue house behind her, the carefully tended garden beds, the wooden swing hanging from the old oak tree. "But you wouldn't understand that, would you? Some of us chose to live instead of—"
"I brought her back!" Dr. Fuji's grip tightened until I had to bite back a wince. "She's alive, Delia. Our daughter is alive again. Look at her face, her eyes—it's her, it has to be her—"
"That's not—that’s not Amber." Delia's words fell like broken glass. "Whatever you've done, whatever you've created..." She forced herself to look at me, really look, like someone pressing on a bruise to prove it hurts. When she finally spoke again, her voice cracked. "Our daughter is gone, and this—" her hand trembled as she gestured at me, "this is just another experiment. Another way to avoid facing what happened. The cancer—"
That word—cancer—carried the weight of years of grief. The setting sun caught in her hair, painting her in shades of gold that made the whole scene feel like some twisted memorial photo.
A breeze stirred the flowers, carrying the scent of freshly turned earth and something that might have been dinner cooking inside that cheerful blue house. Some other version of this evening existed where they'd all be sitting down to eat right now, if we hadn't shown up to shatter their peace.
Dr. Fuji's fingers dug so deep into my shoulder that I could feel each individual digit trembling. Not with grief or shame, but with that particular kind of desperate anger that comes when someone's carefully constructed reality starts to crack. "You don't understand," he said, his voice rising to match the wind. "I did it. I actually did it! While you were here playing house with—" he released my shoulder to jab a finger at Ash's father, "—with some lab assistant," he spat the words like they tasted foul, "I brought our daughter back! I did what everyone said was impossible! This is what I promised you, what you never believed I could—"
"Get off my property." Delia's voice cut through his rant like a knife. Her shadow stretched long across her garden, merging with the darkness gathering at the edges of this broken family tableau. "Before I call Officer Jenny."
The silence stretched between them like a thread pulled too tight. I looked up at Dr. Fuji, watching shadows crawl across his face as the sun sank lower, dreading the moment something—
His hand suddenly lifted from my shoulder. The absence of pressure was so unexpected I stumbled slightly, catching myself just as he spun on his heel. No words, no final desperate plea—he simply stormed back to the car in sharp, angry steps that sent gravel flying.
The engine roared to life, gears protesting as he threw it into reverse. Only then did it hit me: he was leaving. Actually leaving me here, surrounded by the fragments of a family I both did and didn't know, in a world that kept refusing to match my memories. 
First my old life, then Ditto, and now even the man who'd caused all of this—all of them slipping away like water through cupped hands.
I stood frozen, conflicted, in the lengthening shadows of Delia's garden, listening to the sound of tires on dirt fade into the distance.
</Chapter>

<Chapter title="[Chapter 12] A Very Reasonable Man" file="story/12.txt">
A winding path cut through the trees on Pallet Town's outskirts. Dr. Fuji fidgeted on a fallen log, where he’d spent the afternoon, a manila folder gripped tightly in his lap.
Through the branches, Oak's lab silhouetted against the afternoon sky. Champion Oak. Professor Oak now. The grant ceremony seemed a lifetime ago—Oak's firm handshake, flashing cameras, admiring looks. 
Yet here Dr. Fuji sat, overshadowed while Oak transitioned from victory to victory, as if remaking a life were as simple as a title change.
He spread the folder’s contents across the damp bark: surveillance reports from Domino mixed with photos old and new. The older ones, soft-edged from years of handling, showed happier times—their wedding day, beach trips with little Amber building sandcastles, family picnics in the summer sun.
The newer photos captured Delia around her restaurant, in her garden, and walking through town. His fingers trembled slightly as he sifted through them. He found a few that stood out: Delia laughing at her garden gate, Stephen's arm draped her shoulders.
"Just a reasonable discussion," he muttered, taking out his pen. The ink moved methodically across Stephen's face. "Man to man. You must understand that Delia and I..." His hand pressed harder, the pen tip catching on the glossy surface. “We kind of have a history.”
Another photo. Stephen and Delia at some local festival together. His pen dug into the paper, scratching violently until it tore through. "I'm not being unreasonable." The next one—their garden. His fingers seized the edge of Stephen's figure and ripped, the sound sharp in the quiet afternoon. "I just need you to understand..." He was tearing them now, hands shaking as pieces fell around his feet like strange confetti. "...that you're in the way of something bigger than yourself."
A young trainer passed by with her Rattata, giving him an uncertain glance before hurrying on. The sound of footsteps pulled Dr. Fuji from his frenzy, and he quickly gathered the scattered pieces, stuffing them back into the folder. 
His hands steadied as he checked his watch. Soon. Stephen took this path to the lab, so he’ll probably take the same path back. Just two reasonable men, having a discussion about Delia's future.
The shadows had shifted since dawn, when he'd first noticed Stephen walking this path. Dr. Fuji's legs had gone numb hours ago, but he barely registered the discomfort. 
Last night's confrontation in Delia's garden replayed incessantly, each memory morphing into something more twisted. Her accusations of "trying to play god," her dismissal of his life's work as just "another experiment," the disdain she'd looked at Amber like she was a mere thing instead of their daughter—it all twisted into something darker with each echo. And that final command to leave their property? As if he were just some stranger disrupting her perfect little life with her lab assistant.
He'd been tenured at Celadon University while Stephen was probably still fumbling with undergraduate chemistry sets, pioneering genetic research while this... this lab assistant was likely still trying to memorize the basic type chart.
He'd spent the day here, watching Oak's lab through the trees, watching the path, shuffling through his photos until the edges went soft.
That cheerful blue house of hers, with its wooden swing and carefully tended garden beds, kept swimming before his eyes. Such pastoral mediocrity. Yet she'd chosen that—chosen Stephen—over everything he'd accomplished, everything he'd promised her he'd do.
The sound of footsteps along gravel pulled him from his spiral. Stephen was right on schedule, probably heading home to make dinner in that cozy kitchen. The sight of him sent a wave of static through Dr. Fuji's mind, drowning out the words he'd rehearsed all day. His hand found a Pokeball in his pocket, fingers trembling slightly.
"Hey." Dr. Fuji’s voice broke as he stepped onto the path. "We need to talk about Delia."
Stephen stopped, briefcase shifting in his grip. His expression was guarded, but not yet afraid. 
"Dr. Fuji." He spoke like someone approaching a wounded Pokémon. "What you're doing with that child... Delia told me everything about Amber. About what happened. I understand what you went through, but—"
"Understand?" The word tasted like acid. "You understand?" Dr. Fuji's hand tightened around the Pokeball. The static in his head crescendoed, drowning out whatever patronizing comfort this lab assistant thought he could offer. "I was reconstructing genetic sequences while you were still learning how to operate a centrifuge. I brought our daughter back while you were... what? Filing reports? Cleaning test tubes?"
"Sir, please." Stephen set his briefcase down slowly, his hand moving toward his neck, but paused as he felt nothing. "You're not thinking clearly. Why don't we—"
"I brought her back!" The words burst out of him. "I did what no one else could do, what they said was impossible. And now you... you dare to judge me? To stand there in what should be my house, with my wife, while my daughter..."
His hands clenched into claws at his sides, tendons bulging. For a moment, only his ragged breathing filled the air. When he spoke again, his voice stripped bare of any pretense.
"Ditto!" The Pokéball arced through the air, exploding with red light, and releasing a small pink blob. "Protocol Five."
The pink blob erupted upward like a geyser, twisting and contorting until a massive serpentine form blocked out the afternoon sun.
Stephen stumbled backward, fumbling in his pockets for a Pokéball. "Poliwag, help—"
The tiny tadpole materialized, looking pitifully fragile under Ditto-Gyarados's coiled form. A tremor shook the great serpent's body—hesitation, or resistance?—but Dr. Fuji's next words cut through the air like a knife:
"Dragon Rage."
The pink-purple flames roared through the evening air. The Poliwag tried to dodge, but the attack's ferocity left nowhere to go. The blast engulfed the area, kicking up dust and debris.
Pink-purple flames roared through the evening air, superheating the atmosphere with a thunderous crack. The Poliwag tried to dodge, its tiny legs scrambling against scorched earth, but the attack's ferocity left nowhere to go. The blast engulfed the area with a small explosion, sending debris and superheated air rolling outward in a devastating wave.
When the dust cleared, Poliwag lay motionless in a scorched crater. Stephen was already running forward, reaching for his fallen Pokemon. "Poliwag! Are you—"
"Hyper Beam."
Ditto-Gyarados's massive form shuddered. For a heartbeat, its eyes met Stephen's—and in them was something almost human. The great serpentine body coiled backward, resisting.
"I said Hyper Beam!" Dr. Fuji's voice cracked with hysteria as he pointed towards the only obstacle remaining. "NOW!"
Another heartbeat of resistance—scales trembling, eyes squeezed shut—then a white-hot beam erupted from its maw.
The blinding light of Hyper Beam carved a trench through the earth. As the devastating attack subsided, the forest path transformed into a scorched corridor shrouded in darkness. Steam wafted from the charred ground, and the acrid tang of ozone pervaded the air.
Ditto-Gyarados wavered, its massive form beginning to lose cohesion as patches of pink showed through the blue scales. Dr. Fuji walked forward through the devastation, shoes crunching on scorched earth. He stopped at the edge of the impact zone, where Stephen's body lay crumpled beside Poliwag.
His foot nudged the man and the small tadpole Pokemon. He briefly glanced back at the giant serpentine monster behind him, annoyance clearly visible on his face. "Ditto. Why did you hold back? Finish them. Bite."
The great serpentine form shuddered, scales rippling as Ditto fought against the command. Its eyes, still holding that terrible awareness, squeezed shut.
Silence stretched between them, broken only by the soft crackle of burning grass.
"I... created... you." Dr. Fuji whispered dangerously. Ditto's form wavered further, pink seeping through the scales as its transformation began to collapse. "You exist because of me. How dare you defy me now?"
The great serpentine form trembled, then began to shrink, refusing the command. Dr. Fuji's face twisted with rage as he raised the Pokeball.
"Useless." His hand shook as he recalled the Ditto. "Mewtwo killed twenty-three of Team Rocket’s best scientists the moment it awoke. But you act like you're a…”
He stared down at Ditto's Pokeball for a long moment, something flickering behind his eyes. Then his other hand moved to a different ball, and whatever had passed across his face vanished completely.
"Magmar." His voice was steady now, almost serene. The fire Pokemon materialized in a flash of red light, its flame-wreathed form casting dancing shadows across the scorched earth. "Incinerate the bodies. Leave nothing."
The Magmar's flames ignited instantly, no hesitation, no flicker of doubt—just pure mechanical obedience. Its maw opened, and blue-white fire roared forth with devastating intensity.
Dr. Fuji watched dispassionately, hands clasped behind his back, as Magmar's flames devoured the fallen Stephen and Poliwag.
He brushed some ash from his sleeve. "Unfortunate, but necessary." He spoke softly to himself as he turned away. "I'll need to console Delia. She'll understand. She has to."
The late afternoon sun cast long shadows as he drove through Pallet Town's dirt paths. Nearing Delia's house, he caught a glimpse of her through the hedgerow—kneeling in the garden, meticulously tending her flower beds.
Dr. Fuji's hands tightened on the steering wheel, then deliberately relaxed. No, this wasn't right. Not like this, still smelling of smoke. Delia deserved better. This was, after all, a reunion.
As he watched her tend the garden, memories of their university days flooded back. He'd spent months in the greenhouse, painstakingly cross-breeding varieties until he created the perfect hybrid dahlia—a delicate pink bloom with golden-tipped petals spiraling inward like a mathematical dream, made just for her. When he proposed, the entire conservatory was filled with them.
He'd failed her then, somehow. Been too absorbed in his work, perhaps. Not presented himself properly. But now... now he could do things right.
He drove past without slowing. First, he needed better clothes. Maybe some of the best wine. And dahlias. Were there any in Pallet Town? If not, surely the florists in Viridian City would have something suitable. He could return later, properly dressed and prepared. Do things right this time. Do things right again.
Behind him, in the distance, a column of smoke still rose from the forest path near Oak's laboratory.

<Chapter title="[Chapter 13] Sweet Home" file="story/13.txt">
As the sound of tires on dirt faded into the distance, Stephen placed a gentle but firm hand on my shoulder. He guided me into the house, past a worn lab coat hanging like a ghost on the wall. The house smelled of curry and clean laundry—so different from the artificial sterility of Dr. Fuji's apartment that my steps faltered.
A display case mounted above the fireplace caught my eye: eight badges gleaming under glass, arranged with care. Below them, Ash had spread cards—Pokemon Cards?—across the coffee table in a matching pattern, Poliwag waddling between the neat rows with surprising care.
"Sit," Stephen said from the kitchen doorway. I could hear Delia continue her work outside, the soft snip of shears punctuating the evening quiet. "Are you hungry? We have leftover curry."
My first instinct was to refuse politely. But my stomach had other ideas, reminding me that my last meal had been that sad bowl of soggy cereal this morning. Dr. Fuji hadn't exactly prioritized lunch during his dramatic family reunion planning.
Stephen chuckled as he heard my stomach growl.
Without a proper response from me, he shuffled to the fridge to pull two containers from the fridge—curry in one, perfectly packed rice in the other. As he leaned in, a Pokeball swung free from his shirt collar, hanging from a worn chain around his neck.
Steam still fogged the lids, suggesting dinner had only recently ended. As he assembled the plate, rich spices filled the air with the kind of homemade comfort that Dr. Fuji's apartment had never known.
"It might need reheating, It’s been in the fridge for a bit," Stephen said, studying my face with genuine concern. "Delia says the curry needs to be properly hot to bring out the flavors. Unless you prefer it this way?"
I shrugged, watching as he placed the plate in the microwave.
Through the kitchen window, I could see Delia's shadow stretching across her garden beds, growing longer as the sun sank lower.
As the plate rotated slowly behind the glass, my eyes drifted to those badges gleaming above the fireplace. The question slipped out before I could stop it: "Were you a trainer?"
Stephen's hand briefly touched something under his shirt collar before dropping away. "A lifetime ago," he said quietly, something haunted crossing his face.
"What happened?" The question slipped out before I could stop myself.
His eyes lifted to the badge display's reflection in the kitchen window. For a moment, something raw and grief-stricken crossed his face. Then he shook his head, shoulders slumping slightly. "I wasn't a good enough trainer back then. But I think now we…"
His voice trailed off into nothing, leaving only the steady hum of the microwave to fill the kitchen's sudden silence.
The microwave dinged. Stephen set the steaming plate in front of me, then rolled his sleeves back up, returning to the sink where soap suds climbed toward his elbows as he tackled what looked like a particularly stubborn pot.
The curry was surprisingly good—far better than I'd expected. Something about restaurants in Pallet Town tugged at my memory, but the thought dissolved before I could grasp it. 
What remained was simply this: each bite carried layers of flavor that spoke of careful preparation, of someone taking the time to toast spices and slow-cook onions until they practically melted.
When I finished, Stephen dried his hands and reached into a high cabinet. "Here," he said, offering me the cookie with a gentle smile. "You look like you could use something sweet."
"Hey!" A young voice made me jump. Ash stood in the kitchen doorway, Poliwag peering around his legs. "That's not fair! Mom said I couldn't have any cookies tonight! Why does she get them!" 
"Ash," Stephen started, but Ash was already moving closer, curiosity overtaking his initial protest. "Ash, that’s because you and Poliwag tracked mud into—let her—"
"Who are you anyway?" Ash demanded, turning to me. "Why're you eating our cookies?”
"Poli pol!" Poliwag added, waddling over to investigate the cookie crumbs.
I looked down at the cookie, then at Ash's frown, then back at the cookie. I carefully broke it in half—not quite even, giving him the slightly bigger piece.
"Here," I said, holding out half. I internally struggled with myself, wanting to take my hand back and eat it all. Dr. Fuji didn’t really have many sweets in his apartment. But I was an adult. "Want… to share?"
Ash's eyes widened, anger forgotten in the face of cookie diplomacy. He glanced at Stephen, who hesitated, eyes flickering to where Delia worked in the garden before giving a small, almost conspiratorial nod.
"Thanks!" Ash dropped into the chair next to me, cookie already halfway to his mouth. "I'm Ash, and that's Poliwag. He's not officially mine yet 'cause I'm not old enough, but he will be. What's your name?"
The cookie turned to dust in my mouth. Such a simple question—the kind you're supposed to answer without thinking. But my name... was it the one from college? From my previous life? The identity Dr. Fuji had tried to force on me? Or something new entirely?
Through the window, I could see Delia's shadow growing longer across her flowerbeds. The evening light caught her garden shears, making them flash like warning signals as she worked.
"She's had a long day, Ash," Stephen cut in smoothly, saving me from drowning in my own thoughts. "Why don't you tell her about that new move you've been teaching Poliwag instead?"
"Oh man, you should see what Poliwag can do!" Ash practically vibrated with excitement, previous cookie crimes forgotten. "We've been practicing Water Gun for weeks! Well, mostly inside 'cause of the rain, which is why we're in trouble, but—" He bounced up from his chair. "Can I show her, Dad? Please? Just a tiny demonstration?"
"Outside only," Stephen said firmly, though I caught the hint of a smile. "And aim away from your mother's flowers."
"Yes! Come on!" Ash was already heading for the door, Poliwag bouncing excitedly at his heels. He turned back when he reached the door, practically vibrating with eagerness. "You coming?"
“Sure,” I said as I followed them out, cookie crumbs still sticking to my fingers like tiny breadcrumbs marking my path.
Delia straightened from her flower beds as we passed, her hands stilling on her shears. The metal caught the dying light, flashing orange-red like a warning. Her eyes followed us, carrying the weight of questions I couldn't answer.
Ash charged ahead to a worn patch of grass beyond the garden, Poliwag bouncing at his heels. Behind us, Stephen paused beside Delia, their voices dropping too low to hear.
The worn patch of grass beyond the flower beds told its own story: muddy spots and small pools marking endless attempts at mastering Water Gun, still visible even in the failing light.
"Okay, Poliwag!" Ash threw his arms wide with childish drama. 
Poliwag was already bouncing forward, too excited to wait for actual commands. The Water Gun burst out in an enthusiastic but uncontrolled spray, sending both of us scrambling backward, laughing.
"See? I told you he was strong!" Ash bounced in place, rain-soaked but grinning. "Dad's been helping us practice aim, but Poliwag gets too excited sometimes. Right, buddy?"
"Poli!" The Pokemon nodded enthusiastically, sending water droplets flying.
"How long have you been training together?" I asked while chuckling. Strange to think this was the same Ash who would someday face down legendary Pokemon without flinching.
"Three whole months!" He dropped down beside Poliwag, scratching under its chin. "Since the river incident. Poliwag tried to save me, and Dad caught him after." His voice held that peculiar pride kids get when telling stories about their own near-disasters. "Now we train here where it's safe. Plus, Dad says it's good practice—Poliwag's gonna be my official starter once I'm old enough!"
"I'm gonna be the greatest Pokemon Master ever!" Ash declared between Water Gun attempts, fist pumped toward the orange sky. "Once I'm old enough, me and Poliwag will travel everywhere and I’ll catch 'em all!"
"Poli pol!" Poliwag bounced proudly, agreeing with Ash.
Behind us, I heard Stephen and Delia talking in low voices. Their words were lost to the evening breeze, probably discussing me. 
I focused instead on Ash's increasingly chaotic "special moves" demonstration, each attempt ending in more splashing and laughter.
"I'm gonna be the greatest Pokemon Master ever!" Ash declared between Water Gun attempts, fist pumped toward the orange sky. "Once I'm old enough, me and Poliwag will travel everywhere and catch 'em all!"
The sunset painted everything in deepening shades of orange, turning water droplets into tiny prisms as they caught the light. Looking at this soaking wet kid with impossible dreams, I couldn't help but smile. 
Someday he really would become the Pokemon Master and inspire countless trainers. And his journey would go on to inspire hundreds of millions of fans. But right now, he was just Ash, practicing in his backyard with his future starter—Poliwag?—completely unaware of his own destiny.
"Time to come in!" Stephen's voice cut through the twilight. "Before you both catch colds."
Ash made a token protest, but Poliwag was already waddling toward the house, leaving tiny wet footprints on the stepping stones. I followed, suddenly aware of how my dress clung damply to my skin.
Inside, the kitchen lights cast warm pools across water-spotted floors. Stephen appeared with an armful of towels, tossing one to Ash before holding another out to me. "Did you have fun?"
I nodded, carefully patting my face dry. The towel smelled of sunshine and fresh air—so different from the artificial lavender Dr. Fuji insisted on.
"Ash, shower time," Stephen said, collecting the wet towels. "And don't forget to dry Poliwag properly this time."
"But Dad he’s a water—"
"No buts. You know the rules about wet Pokemon in bed."
Ash thundered up the stairs, Poliwag bouncing after him with surprising grace for something shaped like a beach ball with legs. Their footsteps echoed through the ceiling, followed by the familiar sounds of a shower starting up.
I sank into one of the kitchen chairs while Stephen rinsed my curry plate. Everything about this kitchen spoke of a life well-lived—worn wooden table, mismatched dishes in the drying rack, a calendar covered in Ash's messy handwriting tracking Poliwag's training progress. The kind of collected history Dr. Fuji's hastily set up apartment tried to manufacture.
Stephen dried his hands on a dishtowel, then absently adjusted the chain around his neck. Silence stretched between us, punctuated by Ash's muffled singing from upstairs and the soft clink of Delia putting away her garden tools outside.
"So," he said finally. His voice carried the careful tone of someone who'd spent years helping raise a child, knowing when to push and when to wait. "Do you... remember anything? About before?"
‘What a loaded question.’
Above us, Ash was belting out what sounded like the Pokemon theme song, completely off-key and completely happy. Through the window, Delia's shadow moved across the garden one last time, checking her work.
"Delia had told me some things," Stephen continued carefully when I didn't answer. "About how Amber died, her previous daughter died. About how Dr. Fuji became... obsessed." He leaned against the counter, arms crossed, eyes studying the worn linoleum. "I never thought he'd actually come back. Not like this… not with a… you." His gaze flickered to me, then away, as if avoiding the word 'clone' might make the situation less surreal.
I traced a scratch in the kitchen table's surface, following its path through the wood. How could I explain that Dr. Fuji's obsession hadn't ended with bringing back Amber? That every detail of my existence now had to match some perfect memory he carried?
"Is there anything you need?" Stephen asked quietly. "To feel more comfortable here?"
The question caught me off guard. I stared at the scratch on the table, finger frozen, about to turn a corner along its path. 
A couple weeks ago, in my dorm room, I would've just said time—more time to play Pokémon games. But now that I was in one... I wasn't sure what I needed anymore.
"I don't know," I muttered.
Stephen just nodded, as if uncertainty was the most natural response in the world. Above us, Ash's muffled voice had switched from singing to what sounded like a passionate discussion with Poliwag about proper towel usage.
He pushed away from the counter. "You'll stay in the guest room tonight. It's small, but..." He opened a cabinet, a smile warming his voice. "And since Ash isn't here to claim his share—want another cookie?"
I nodded, surprised by how much I wanted that simple comfort after tasting just a bit of it.
He handed the cookie to me, then glanced at my mud-spattered dress with amusement. "You should probably wash up once Ash is done. Don't want to go to bed like a Mudkip, right?" He chuckled at his own joke. "Just... let us know if you need anything, okay?"
I nodded, slowly nibbling on the satisfyingly sweet sweet.

<Chapter title="[Chapter 14] Flowers for Delia" file="story/14.txt">
Morning came with the sound of Pidgey calls and clinking plates downstairs. The guest room was small but cozy, its yellow walls a welcome change from the stark white of Dr. Fuji's apartment.
I found clothes laid out on a chair—borrowed from Ash, a simple t-shirt and shorts. They still carried a faint scent of laundry detergent. 
I nodded, thankful to be finally rid of the dress. I never liked dresses, especially those frilly ones.
Downstairs, the kitchen smelled of coffee and maple syrup. Stephen stood at the stove, flipping pancakes while Ash set the table, occasionally shooting me curious glances. Under the table, Poliwag sat with its bowl of mixed berries—Oran, Pecha, and what looked like Sitrus—alternating between delicately picking at its breakfast and hopefully watching for dropped pancake bits.
"Morning," Stephen said without turning. "Sleep okay?"
I nodded, then realized he couldn't see me. "Yes, thank you."
Stephen turned from the stove, spatula in hand, and slid the first perfectly golden pancake onto a plate. He placed it in front of me with a warm smile.
"Hey!" Ash protested immediately. "How come she gets the first one?"
Stephen raised an eyebrow. "We have a guest, Ash."
"But—" Ash started, then caught his father's look and slumped in his chair. "Fine," he muttered, shooting me a quick, suspicious glance.
"Yours is coming right up, bud," Stephen said, pouring more batter into the pan, "And this one's bigger."
This seemed to mollify Ash, though he continued watching me from the corner of his eye as if I might somehow steal his breakfast too. 
Stephen set a bottle of maple syrup down in front of me. "Dig in. They're best when they're hot."
Ash tracked the bottle's movement with the intensity of a Fearow watching prey, his eyes narrowing as I picked it up.
I drizzled a modest amount over my pancake at first—the responsible adult portion my brain suggested was appropriate. 
But something about the warm, golden scent rising from the plate stirred a craving I couldn't ignore. Before I knew it, I was tipping the bottle again, watching amber liquid pool in the divots of the pancake.
"Whoa, you like syrup even more than me!" Ash exclaimed, his jealousy momentarily overcome by wide-eyed admiration.
I blinked at my creation—a sugar swamp that my college-self would have dismissed as disgusting. 
But when I took that first bite, the sweetness hit my taste buds like a revelation. My adult mind registered it as overwhelmingly saccharine, but my body responded with pure delight.
"Good, right?" Stephen asked with a knowing smile.
I nodded, already cutting another syrup-soaked piece. Apparently, this body came with its own super sweet tooth.
Stephen slid a stack of three perfectly golden pancakes onto Ash's plate. "Here you go, champ."
Ash immediately grabbed the syrup bottle, tilting it with wild abandon. The sweet liquid splashed and pooled haphazardly, some hitting the pancakes, some creating sticky puddles on the plate, and a few drops landing on the table. From below, Poliwag's excited "Poli!" suggested at least a few drops had made it to the floor.
"Whoa, easy there," Stephen said, reaching for the bottle. "That's way too—"
"But she used even more!" Ash protested, jerking his chin toward me while maintaining his death grip on the syrup.
Stephen's hand froze mid-reach. His eyes darted to my syrup-flooded plate, then back to Ash's half-drowned stack.
I shrunk a little in my chair, taking a hesitant bite as Stephen's gaze wandered to my plate. The sweetness now seemed somehow incriminating.
"Well, I..." he began, scratching the back of his head, then sighed in defeat. "Fair point."
"Just..." Stephen continued, lowering his voice conspiratorially, "don't tell your mother, okay? Either of you."
Ash nodded solemnly, as if they were negotiating state secrets rather than breakfast condiments. Then he dug in with gusto, syrup dripping from his fork with each enthusiastic bite.
We finished our pancakes in companionable silence, interrupted only by Ash's occasional appreciative "Mmm!" and the clinking of forks against plates. As Stephen collected our empty dishes, he glanced at the clock on the wall.
"Almost time for school, Ash. Go grab your backpack—we leave in five minutes."
"Okay!" Ash bolted up the stairs with thundering footsteps that seemed excessive for someone so small. Poliwag waddled after him with the same excitement.
Stephen laughed as he watched his son rush up the stairs, but there was something thoughtful in his expression as he looked at me. His hand went to the worn Pokeball at his neck. "Before we leave..."
The chain clinked softly as Stephen lifted the worn Pokeball from his neck. "This is the girl we discussed last night," he said quietly.
When Electabuzz materialized, the kitchen felt suddenly smaller. Battle scars crossed its yellow fur like a map of old conflicts, the deepest running from shoulder to chest. Small sparks danced between its antennae as it sized me up.
"Buzz, buzz," Electabuzz sighed, crossing its arms with weary patience. The gesture pulled at the old scar running across its chest, a pale line visible even through the yellow fur.
"Come on, just for today," Stephen coaxed. "I said I’ll make it up to you tomorrow. Maybe see if Professor Oak will let us borrow Dragonite for a proper spar?"
Electabuzz's antennae crackled with sudden interest. The resigned slump of its shoulders straightened, competitive fire flickering in its eyes.
"There's that fighting spirit," Stephen grinned. 
Then, turning to me: "Electabuzz here, he’ll keep an eye on things until Delia gets back. And anything happens…" Stephen started.
“If Dr. Fuji shows up?” I supplied quietly.
Stephen glanced at Electabuzz. The electric-type bumped his fists together, sparks dancing between them.
"Buzz Electabuzz!" Electabuzz gave a loud battle cry.
Stephen's grip tightened on the chair. "Yeah. That. Electabuzz wouldn't let him near you." He paused, studying my face. "Unless you wanted to stay—"
I shook my head. "No, not with Dr. Fuji."
The words came easily. That crazy scientist kinda gave me a bad feeling. But it stirred memories of another friend that was still with Dr. Fuji. I wonder if it saw me as a friend.
Stephen nodded silently, looking me over with concern.
"I'll be fine," I said, glancing at Electabuzz with a smile. "We can bond—" Electabuzz snorted at the word, and I dropped a quiet "probably."
Stephen chuckled, ruffling my hair with casual affection that felt both foreign and comforting. "Don't take it personally. Buzz here isn't exactly the nurturing type.”
Electabuzz grunted in confirmation, crossing muscled arms over his scarred chest.
Thundering footsteps answered as Ash careened down the stairs, backpack bouncing wildly against his shoulders while Poliwag trailed after him. He skidded to a stop at the bottom, eyes widening at the sight of Electabuzz.
"Whoa! Dad, is Buzz staying home today?" His disappointment morphed instantly to excitement. "Can I stay too? Please? I want to train—"
"School, Ash," Stephen said firmly, guiding him toward the door.
Ash dug his heels in suddenly, turning to look at me with narrowed eyes. "Wait! What about her?"
Stephen's hand froze on Ash's shoulder as he paused before slowly continuing, “She just arrived. She’ll go to school like you once she settles in.”
Ash's face darkened as he shot me a resentful glare, "Not fair," he grumbled, shoulders slumping as he allowed himself to be guided toward the door.
"There's leftover curry in the fridge for lunch! Just ask Electabuzz if you can't reach it!" Stephen said, then paused to return Poliwag to its ball. 
“Buzz,” Electabuzz snorted, shaking his head with a slight smirk.
I watched through the window as father and son raced down the path, their laughter carrying on the morning breeze. Just another ordinary morning in Pallet Town.
Except nothing about this felt ordinary for me.
I turned to find Electabuzz watching me, arms crossed, sparks casually dancing between his antennae.
Time to figure out how to spend a morning with my new bodyguard. Maybe he’ll be like Ditto?
-[^.^]-
He was not like Ditto.
Where my previous shapeshifting friend had evolved from formal guardian to playful companion, Electabuzz maintained his professional distance.
It scoffed at my attempts to copy his stance, sparks crackling with what might have been annoyance when I mimicked the way he crossed his arms or tried to make funny faces.
I soon gave up and began to explore the house. Electabuzz followed me wherever I went like the diligent bodyguard he was.
Crayon drawings covered the fridge—earlier ones showing wobbly Weedle, Oddish, Rattata, and Butterfree and Caterpie, newer ones proudly featuring a round blue Poliwag. Near the kitchen doorway, pencil marks tracked Ash's height through the years, each line dated in either a neat or messy script.
I wandered upstairs and paused at Ash’s room. Curiosity overcame any sense of boundary—this was THE Ash Ketchum's house, after all.
His room was exactly what you'd expect of a kid: clothes scattered everywhere, half-read Pokemon magazines sprawled open on the floor. I didn't linger long, just enough to spot a well-worn guidebook to Kanto Pokemon buried under some laundry.
The morning dragged on. Between sets of push-ups and squats, I watched some random battle broadcast and studied Stephen's badge case mounted above the fireplace—eight badges gleaming under glass, arranged with pride.
A dual-toned green plant-like emblem, a metallic gray octagonal piece, a gleaming blue water droplet, a red crystalline design, a simple yellow circle, a pink heart shape, a multi-colored flower medallion, and a radiant orange sunburst badge. All 8 of the Kanto badges.
I glanced at Electabuzz, who followed my gaze and snorted. His antennae sparked with what might have been pride... or maybe regret.
Moving closer, I noticed something I'd missed before. Hidden partially behind the badge case was a small, worn black and white photograph
I recognized Electabuzz, though back then the scar across his chest was just unmarked yellow fur. The others... a Graveler with determination in its rocky features, a Pidgeotto still growing into its crest feathers, a proud Growlithe, and a Machop flexing with endearing enthusiasm.
Stephen's words from last night echoed: "I wasn't good enough back then."
I glanced at Electabuzz. He stood motionless, staring at the photo, antennae drooping slightly. For a moment, the stern guardian was gone, replaced by something older and sadder.
Then, my stomach growled loudly, breaking the spell.
Electabuzz shifted, glancing at my stomach with what might have been amusement.
With a businesslike grunt, he gestured toward the kitchen, antennae sparking back to their alert position.
I followed him into the kitchen, where he reached into the refrigerator and pulled the container of curry and rice, reheating it.
Then, he reached back into the fridge to grab a huge container of mixed berries—similar to what Poliwag had for breakfast.
We ate in silence, the only sounds being my spoon against the bowl and the soft crunch as Electabuzz methodically worked through his berries.
After lunch, Electabuzz just tossed the dishes into the sink with a clatter that made me wince, apparently considering his caretaking duties complete for now.
I jumped onto the couch and continued watching the next pokemon battle broadcast. I settled in, trying to follow along with the announcers' rapid-fire commentary about type advantages and counter-strategies, focusing more on the commentary now that my energy had been partially exhausted.
Electabuzz silently stood next to the couch and watched the broadcast with a glint in his eyes—Nostalgia?
The front door slammed open with enough force to make Electabuzz flinch. Ash burst into the living room like a miniature hurricane, backpack half-unzipped and hanging precariously from one shoulder.
"Whoaaa! Is that Clair’s Blastoise?" He vaulted over the back of the couch and landed beside me with a bounce that nearly sent me airborne. "Hydro Cannon is so powerful!"
I blinked, startled by the sudden invasion of my quiet afternoon. Electabuzz made a sound somewhere between a grunt and a sigh.
Delia appeared in the doorway moments later, her expression shifting from mild exasperation at her son to a careful as her gaze passed me. She lingered at the threshold, one hand resting on the doorframe.
"The way Blastoise times those water pulses is genius!" Ash continued, not noticing my surprise or his mother's hesitation. He mimicked a cannon-firing motion with his arms. "See how he waits until the very last second? Dad says that's advanced timing."
On screen, the Blastoise executed a perfect counter-blast, sending its opponent skidding across the arena. The crowd roared.
"Yeah, it's—" I started, but Delia cleared her throat.
"Ash," she said, her voice firm but not harsh. "You can watch the match later. Homework first."
"But Mo-om," Ash dragged out the word. "It’s Clair's Blastoise!"
"Homework," Delia repeated, finally stepping fully into the room. Her eyes flicked briefly to me, then away. “There will probably be reruns later.”
Ash slumped dramatically against the couch cushions. "Fine," he grumbled, but made no move to get up. "Who’s your favorite trainer?" he asked me, lowering his voice as if Delia might not hear him from six feet away.
"Ash." Just his name this time, but with a warning tone that made him sigh loudly.
"Okay, okay." He hauled himself up, dragging his backpack behind him. At the foot of the stairs, he turned back. "Can I watch now and then do homework after dinner? Pleeeease? It’s a Blastoise!"
Delia's expression softened as she glanced at the TV, then at her son—carefully keeping me at the edge of her vision. "Maybe you could try to do your homework during the commercials."
Ash's face lit up. "Really? Yes!" He bounded back to the couch, nearly tripping over his own backpack in his rush. "Did you see that counter just now? The way Blastoise—" He paused mid-gesture, suddenly self-conscious. "Um, do you like Pokemon battles?"
"Do I like Pokemon battles?" The question caught me off guard. After all, my only real experience was through games and—
"Like Pokemon battles?" I grinned, settling more comfortably on the couch. "Of course I do! My entire life I’ve—”
"Right?" Ash's face lit up even more. "Did you see that Hydro Cannon earlier?"
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ROUND THREE AFTER THESE MESSAGES FROM OUR SPONSORS!"
"Oh! Commercial!" Ash scrambled to grab his worksheet, nearly dropping it in his enthusiasm.
"Fifteen times seven..." Ash muttered, scribbling confidently. A very wrong '3' appeared on the page.
"That's not—" Delia and I started at the same time. We both stopped.
I glanced up to find her standing in the doorway. She met my eyes for a brief moment, then nodded slightly and stepped back. "Go ahead," she said softly.
"Okay, let's try this step by step," I said, turning toward Ash. "First rule—always start with the ones..."
We worked through the multiplication problems between bursts of battle and commercials. Ash's pencil would freeze mid-calculation every time a pokemon appeared on screen.
"So seven times five is—"
"OH WATCH THIS!" Ash pointed frantically at the TV. "See how Blastoise's cannons are angled? That means—"
"Rapid Spin!" the trainer—Clair?—shouted as Blastoise tucked itself into its shell and whirled into motion. The massive turtle Pokemon became a blur of brown and blue, its rotation thundering across the arena as it kicked up clouds of dirt.
"Swift! Break its rotation!" The opposing trainer called. His Skarmory's wings flashed as it launched a barrage of star-shaped energy.
The energy stars scattered in brilliant flashes against Blastoise's spinning shell, but the massive Pokemon plowed through, clearing the scattered spikes from the field in its wake, until Clair held out her pokeball and returned it.
As the dust settled, the camera panned across the battlefield. Skarmory landed with a metallic rustle, both trainers steady as they considered their next moves.
Then, they cut to the announcer. "And Clair returns her Blastoise! What will be her next pokemon? Find out after a quick word from our sponsors."
"15 times 7," I read aloud, looking at his half-completed attempt. The "3" sat alone, abandoned mid-calculation. I drummed my fingers quickly on the page, aware the commercials wouldn't last long. "Okay, the first rule—always start with the ones. 7 times 5 is...?"
"35!" Ash was practically bouncing in his seat, pencil already scribbling in the 5 after the 3 and trying to move onto the next problem.
“Wait!” I called out, my eyes darting to the commercial about some of the latest Silph Co. battle gear, then back to the paper to tap the ‘1’ in ‘15’, “You did the one’s, now what about the ten’s? The one in front of 15?”
“Oh right!” Ash said as he wrote a 7 in front of his ‘35.’
“Slow down. What are we supposed to do with the 3?”
Before Ash could answer, both our heads snapped up to the TV screen just as a Dragonair materialized in a flash of red light, its blue scales gleaming under the arena lights.
Skarmory launched into the air with a metallic screech, unleashing Air Slash after Air Slash. But Dragonair simply waited, dodging and weaving through the air. When Skarmory finally overextended, Dragonair struck—one precise Ice Beam that caught its opponent's wing mid-flap, freezing it solid.
"AND THAT’S ROUND THREE!" The announcer's voice rose over the crowd's cheers as Skarmory collapsed into the ground with swirls in its eyes. "We'll be right back after these messages from our sponsors!"
Ash picked up his pencil again, then glanced at me expectantly.
"You have to be patient," I said, my eyes catching a TV ad that felt just like back home—smiling stock footage while an announcer speed-read terrifying side effects. 
"Like Clair back there. See how she didn't rush? Step by step, that's how battling works. And that's how we should do this homework."
Understanding flashed in Ash's eyes as I pointed to the 3, then above the '1' in '15'. "This should go here. We don't immediately add it to our answer. We 'carry' the 3. And then we add it to the '7'."
Ash nodded slowly, erasing the '3' and putting it above the '1'. He looked back at me.
"Good, now what is 7 + 3?"
"Ten!" Ash answered, practically bouncing in his seat as he wrote down the 0, carried the 1, then checked for approval.
I chuckled as a contest battle promo flashed across the screen. "Now we can just write that 1 down. It's like a battle strategy—you don't throw everything at once. You position your moves carefully," I gestured at the carried numbers, "saving some power for when you need it most."
Ash's eyes lit up as he carried back down the ‘1’ into the final answer. "So carrying numbers is like... storing up energy for a big move?"
"Exactly!" I grinned, caught up in his enthusiasm. "Each step builds up to—"
The TV cut through our moment: "—and with that Ice Beam, Clair has knocked out 2 of Nolan’s pokemon! What will be Nolan’s last!" 
“—Build to the final answer to win the problem!” I say, but Ash was already paying more attention to the real pokemon battle.
His pencil hovered above the next math question as Nolan's final pokeball burst open. A Hitmonchan materialized, already bouncing on its feet in a fighting stance.
We spent the next few hours like that—Ash bouncing between furious scribbling during commercials and complete absorption in the matches. His arithmetic was getting neater though, more methodical. Whether any of this would stick once the TV was off... Well… that was a different equation entirely.
Sometimes I caught glimpses of Delia in the doorway, watching. She'd linger longest when I was correcting Ash's work. When I looked up and tried to give her a smile, she attempted to smile back, but it was obviously strained.
“Dinner’s ready!” Delia called out from the kitchen.
Ash immediately dropped his pencil mid-equation, practically bouncing toward the smell of tomato sauce. I followed more slowly, my new body's stomach growling despite my mind's hesitation.
Dinner was pasta with a rich tomato sauce that made my mouth water—comfort food. Electabuzz continued to eat his berries. But something felt off about the meal.
“Did you finish your homework?” Delia asked as she glanced at the wall clock. 6:53.
"Yeah, I finished my math homework thanks to..." Ash trailed off, realizing he didn't even know my name.
"Amb... Amber," Delia supplied, her voice catching slightly.
Ash nodded seriously, “Thanks to Amber.”
"What about your other homework?" Delia asked.
Ash paused mid-bite and tried to look away, suddenly very interested in his glass of water.
Delia sighed, setting down her barely-touched fork. "After dinner, then. And no TV this time. Your teachers say you’re falling behind…" She then glanced at me, something uncertain flickering across her face before she continued, "Maybe Amber could..."
"Sure, I can help Ash," I said quickly.
"I don't need help from a g—" Ash started to protest, then caught himself, looking between his mother and me. Perhaps remembering how I had helped him so much with his math homework, his shoulders slumped in defeat. "Fine. But can we at least work in the living room?"
"How was school today?" Delia asked, her eyes drifting to the clock again. 7:02. "Did Ms. Martinez like your science project?"
Ash's face darkened. "Gary and his friends kept saying my presentation was stupid.” After a short pause, he continued, "Mom, when's Dad and Poliwag coming back?"
"Soon, honey." Delia's fork clinked against her plate as she set it down. 7:03. "He's probably just..."
I focused on finishing my pasta, trying not to think too deeply into it. My new body was still hungry despite everything.
The wall clock ticked on as Delia glanced at it yet again, lines of worry etched in her face.
"Ms. Martinez said my project on water Pokémon was 'overly simplistic'," Ash grumbled, stabbing a meatball with his fork. "No wonder Gary and his friends laughed at me."
"I'm sure it was a wonderful project, sweetie," Delia said distractedly, eyes flicking to the clock. "Everyone starts somewhere with their Pokémon knowledge."
When we finished, Delia soaked the plates in the sink, her movements quick and distracted. Ash spread his English workbook across the living room floor, grumbling about vocabulary words.
"I need to go check on something," Delia said, grabbing her coat. She paused at the door, looking at Electabuzz. Some silent understanding passed between them. "Keep guard?"
The electric Pokemon nodded, stance shifting subtly to something more alert.
I watched her hurry down the path, knowing exactly where she was going—to look for Stephen. To see if Dr. Fuji had done to him what he'd done to those other failed experiments.
The next hour blurred into vocabulary definitions and reading comprehension. Ash tried bargaining for TV breaks twice, but I held firm—remembering my own struggles with divided attention back in college.
"We'll finish faster if we focus," I said after his second attempt. "Then we can watch as much TV as your mom allows."
By the time we finished, the wall clock read 7:42. Still no sign of Delia or Stephen.
Ash sprawled across the couch, flipping through channels while Electabuzz watched from its position by the window. I tried to focus on the colorful battle highlights, but my eyes kept drifting to the darkness outside.
Suddenly, headlights filtered through the window, casting long shadows across the living room walls. Electabuzz's growl started low, barely audible, but I felt it in my chest. I switched off the TV mid-battle commentary.
"Hey—" Ash started to protest, but then he saw Electabuzz's stance—muscles coiled, electricity crackling between its antennae.
The car engine cut off. Footsteps crunched on gravel, slow and deliberate.
The doorbell chimed once. Nobody moved.
It chimed again, followed by knocking. "Delia?" Dr. Fuji's voice carried through the door, oddly calm. "My love? I brought your favorites. Dahlias... just like our first date."
More knocking, harder now. "Please, darling. Don't you remember? Your favorite flowers, your namesake..."
After a few moments of pause, the footsteps retreated. For a moment, I felt relief.
I started to breathe again—
The night lit up red. The door exploded inward in a burst of flames and splinters, framing Dr. Fuji in the doorway. 
His white suit was immaculate, not a wrinkle or scorch mark. Pink and yellow petals scattered at his feet as a Magmar's flames illuminated his face from below, casting strange shadows across his empty smile.
“Delia?”
</Chapter>

<Chapter title="[Chapter 15] Electabuzz v Magmar" file="story/15.txt">
The smell of burning wood filled the air as Electabuzz positioned itself between us and the doorway, sparks dancing between its antennae. 
Static electricity prickled against my skin like thousands of tiny needles, making the fine hairs on my arms stand at attention. I grabbed Ash's arm and pulled him behind the couch, my heart pounding against my ribs so hard I thought it might crack them.
Magmar's flames cast writhing shadows across the walls as it stepped through the ruined doorframe, the floorboards smoking beneath its feet. The temperature in the room jumped instantly, making it hard to breathe.
"Move aside," Dr. Fuji commanded Electabuzz, his voice eerily calm. "I'm here for my family. Delia and Amber."
Electabuzz's response was a thunderous roar as electricity surged through its body, the sudden discharge making my hair stand on end. The lights throughout the house flickered and died, plunging everything into darkness broken only by Magmar's orange flames and white-blue arcs of electricity coating Electabuzz's fur.
"Flamethrower," Dr. Fuji commanded.
As flames erupted from Magmar’s mouth, Electabuzz unleashed a crackling thunderbolt that cut through the flamethrower. The collision sent sparks flying in all directions as ozone filled the air, dispersing the flames.
Without hesitation, Electabuzz lunged through the gap, attempting to close the distance before Magmar could breathe more fire. Electricity coursed around his fists as he whirled them like a windmill.
Dr. Fuji took a step backward, his eyes cold as frost despite fire pokemon in front of him. "Fire Spin."
Magmar matched its trainer's retreat while unleashing a continuous stream of flames from its beak. The fire twisted and spiraled at its command, coiling into an expanding vortex that filled the cramped living room. Electabuzz found itself trapped as the spinning flames closed in.
The heat behind the couch became unbearable as fire licked up the walls. Smoke was already starting to fill the room. I grabbed Ash's arm, keeping low. We needed to move now, while Electabuzz still had Magmar's attention.
“Is there another way out?” I whispered.
Ash nodded and coughed back, “Kitchen.”
I covered my mouth with my shirt and started to crawl towards the kitchen, “Stay low to avoid the smoke.”
As we moved, I saw movement beyond the thickening flames—Dr. Fuji and Magmar backing toward the yard through what remained of the front door, the wall around it now largely consumed by flames. Magmar's beak remained open, exhaling a continuous stream of flames that fed the burning vortex around Electabuzz.
Electabuzz snarled as it threw random bursts of electricity, trying to locate its opponent through the swirling fire.
"Straight through the front door!" I shouted through coughs before I could stop myself. "They're moving outside!"
Electabuzz paused for a fraction of a second as his head—a blurry shadow within the flame vortex—snapped toward me.
Dr. Fuji's face darkened as he heard my voice. Magmar snapped its beak shut and both trainer and Pokemon quickly shifted to the side.
A massive burst of electricity erupted from Electabuzz's form, filling the air with crackling energy that lit up the night. The widespread discharge caught Magmar's side, sending sparks cascading across its body as it staggered but maintained its footing.
Flames and ozone choked the air as the Fire Spin began to collapse, the yard now a sea of ash beneath Magmar's feet. Electabuzz burst through the remaining embers and the ruined doorframe, lunging at the Magmar. It whirled its arms while wild arcs of electricity crackled around his fists.
Dr. Fuji stepped back to the battle's edge, one hand slipping into his pocket. His voice cut through the chaos, cold and clear. "Guard with Fire Punch."
Magmar's fists ignited as Electabuzz charged in, arms whirling faster and faster. Electricity snapped between the electric type’s spinning limbs, growing, building. The very air crackled with charge.
“Smokescreen!” Dr. Fuji called as smoke already began to rise from Magmar’s body, where it suddenly burst into a cloud of dust and smoke.
Before the cloud of smoke, Electabuzz planted his feet, and in a single blinding motion, drove an uppercut. Magmar reared back, the attack just grazing its chin—but the near-miss still unleashed a burst of pent-up electricity. 
Lightning sparked across Magmar's face, drawing a pained hiss.
Dr. Fuji frowned as Magmar staggered, flames sputtering, shaking its head to clear the static. In that heartbeat of distraction, Electabuzz lunged while arcs of barely-restrained power trailed behind whirling fists. Stray bolts earthed themselves harmlessly into the scorched ground with each spinning step.
“Back up and Smog!”
Smog belched from Magmar's beak, quickly smothering the yard in noxious fumes. Electabuzz charged into the haze, whirling arms leaving fading arcs in the smoke.
A blast of flames punched through the smog. Electabuzz dove aside, the searing heat singeing its fur as it rolled to its feet. Spinning fists crackled with power as it lunged again.
Magmar sidestepped, flames sheathing its claws. Fire Punch met Thunder Punch in a blinding flash. Lightning and embers rained across the scorched earth.
Shimmering heat rippled the air around Magmar, obscuring its form as it pressed the attack. Dr. Fuji's voice knifed through the night. "Poison Jab!"
“Buzz Electa!”
Venomous claws dug into Electabuzz’s side, drawing a howl from Electabuzz as toxins seeped into the wound.
In turn, however, static electricity crackled across Magmar's body at the contact, stiffening its muscles.
Electabuzz drove through the poison, fists crackling with electricity as his fist exploded against Magmar's chest in a burst of voltage.
The Fire Pokémon flew backwards, crashing into Dr. Fuji’s rented car. Metal crumpled and hissed as Magmar's searing body melted into the frame.
Electabuzz was already lunging forward, fists crackling as its arms whirled to life once again.
"Now, Fire Blast!" Dr. Fuji shouted.
Magmar’s eyes glinted with a fiery spirit as it opened its maw and a five-pronged inferno blasted Electabuzz at point blank range.
Wreathed in flames, Electabuzz smashed into the house in a rain of flaming debris.
Ash and I ducked for cover into the kitchen as a burning rafter collapsed overhead.
In the sudden stillness, I strained to hear any sound from the battlefield, any indication of Electabuzz's fate. Smoke stung my eyes and caught in my throat. 
“Buzz?” Ash coughed, face pale in the dim light of fire filtering through the haze.
The only sounds were the distant crackling of flames and the shifting of debris settling around us. I hardly dared to breathe, my heart pounding in my ears as I waited for something, anything to break the eerie calm.
Ash clutched at my arm, fingers digging into my skin. I could feel him trembling.
“Electabuzz?”
“Electabuzz!” A roar split the air, raw and primal and full of fury, responding to Ash’s whisper. My head snapped up, hardly daring to hope. I scrambled to my knees, ignoring the broken glass that bit into my palms, and peered out through a gap in the wreckage of the kitchen wall.
There, rising from the rubble like a vengeful spirit, was Electabuzz. Its fur was charred and smoking, angry reddish welts standing out starkly against blackened yellow. But its eyes blazed with determination as it threw its head back and roared again, the sound echoing across the ruined house.
Energy crackled around Electabuzz's body, arcing between its antennae and earthing in the rubble at its feet as it spun its arms once again.
With renewed hope, I pushed myself from the hole and grabbed Ash’s arm toward the kitchen door.
“Flamethrower!” Dr. Fuji desperately shouted as a stream of flames erupted behind us. Then, another shout, “Protocol 3!”
We quickly opened the kitchen back door and ran towards the forest.
I glanced back to catch a glimpse of a wild flash of whitish-blue and yellow colliding with red and purple, propelling anime-like shockwaves at the place of impact, sending me and Ash tumbling, my head hitting the ground.
For a moment I lay there dazed, my vision blurred and head throbbing from the impact. Flashes of color still danced in my peripheral vision. Slowly, I pushed myself up to my hands and knees, my balance unsteady. The world seemed to tilt precariously as I struggled to my feet.
An ominous rumble built in intensity, leaves shaking free from the nearby trees. The very earth suddenly lurched violently.
I glanced back to see something massive and purple step forward, pushing its feet into the earth as the earth groaned and shifted, knocking us off balance once again.
I rolled onto my back and squeezed my eyes shut to clear the fog from my brain, took a few wheezy breaths, before pushing myself back up to see the result of the battle.
I stared, my mind reeling, trying to comprehend the devastation before me. The once neat lawn was now a patchwork of scorch marks and upturned earth. 
And there, in the middle of it all, sat Dr. Fuji. He was in a crater of his own making, his white suit now more brown than white, covered in dirt and grime. He looked smaller somehow, diminished, like a puppet whose strings had been cut.
Several paces away, Magmar stood heaving, wisps of smoke still curling from its beak-like mouth. I could feel the heat radiating off it even from here.
‘Is this really Pokemon?’
“Electabuzz!” Ash cried as he started to rush straight on the battlefield—toward the collapsed electric type, crushed between two layers of dirt, fainted with swirls in its eyes.
“No! Wait!” I shouted and lunged forward, tackling Ash to the ground.
"Get—Get off me!" Ash shouted as he attempted to push me off him.
Dr. Fuji looked down at his once-pristine suit, now caked with dirt and ash. The bouquet of flowers he'd brought—variously colored dahlias—laid crushed and scattered around him, petals torn and stems broken.
"The night’s ruined!" he screamed, slamming what remained of the bouquet into the ground. His shoulders heaved with each ragged breath as he stared at the destroyed flowers.
Then, slowly, the wild fury in his eyes cooled as he glanced toward Electabuzz, still pinned between layers of displaced earth.
"It's all your fault," he said, his voice dropping to a loud whisper that somehow carried across the ruined yard. "If you'd just moved aside..."
He stood, brushing futilely at the stains on his suit before looking briefly at Ditto below him. A contemptuous snort escaped him.
"Magmar." His voice was eerily calm now as he pointed toward the Electabuzz. "Finish it."
The Fire Pokémon nodded, flames flickering brighter as it lumbered toward the helpless Electabuzz. Each step left smoking footprints in the grass.
"No! Don’t! That’s Dad’s partner!" Ash's scream was raw with desperation as he thrashed in my arms, trying to break free. "Electabuzz! Get up! Please! Dad said you'd be his Champion Pokémon! Get up!"
I held him tighter, my own heart pounding as Magmar drew closer to its target. Ash's tears soaked into my shirt as he collapsed against me, his struggles weakening into sobs.
I couldn't look away as Magmar loomed over the fallen Electabuzz. The Fire Pokémon's eyes gleamed with an eagerness that made my stomach turn as it raised a flaming claw high into the air.
Electabuzz, his eyes no longer swirling, met Magmar’s gaze with defiance. A weak spark crawled across its body—one last desperate attempt to summon electricity that wouldn't come. Its muscles tensed, trying to move, to fight, to protect—but the earth held it fast.
The flames burst without mercy or hesitation. Magmar drove its burning claw down, pressing it against Electabuzz's chest. The fire spread hungrily across the Electric Pokémon's fur, a terrible crackling sound filling the air as flesh and fur surrendered to flame. 
The horrific sight burned itself into my memory—Magmar's vindictive expression illuminated by its own flames, the way Electabuzz's defiant gaze gradually dimmed, the terrible silence broken only by the roar of fire and Ash's muffled sobs against my shoulder.
I turned away, unable to watch any longer. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Ditto turn away as well, its amorphous body trembling slightly—whether from exhaustion or revulsion, I couldn't tell.
When Magmar finally stepped back, all that remained was a blackened shape that had once been Ash's dad’s pokemon.
"And you," Dr. Fuji finally turned towards me, voice filled with malice. 
He paused, took a deep breath, and his expression softened into something that might have been mistaken for fatherly concern if we hadn't just watched what he'd done.
"Why did you warn it, Amber? Let it know our position?" His voice now carried that same unnaturally calm tone, but a muscle twitched rhythmically at his jaw. "A good daughter doesn't interfere with her father's..." Dr. Fuji's voice trailed off, his eyes momentarily unfocused as if he'd lost track of reality itself.
Debris crunched under his feet as he picked his way through the ruined yard. "I've tried so hard to give you everything again. The same dresses. The same toys. The same love." His voice cracked on the word 'love,' revealing the fractures in his composure. "But you keep... resisting. Fighting against who you are."
"After everything I've done to bring you back?" he asked softly, his eyes finding mine through the gloom. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a single crushed dahlia petal, rubbing it between his fingers. "We can still be a family."
His gaze refocused onto me… no, to Ash, collapsed against me in quiet sobs as I held him protectively in my arms. A cold smile touched Dr. Fuji's lips. "Once I've fully removed this... temporary arrangement Delia created to fill the void I left behind, we'll be a proper family again. The way we were always meant to be. Just one more step…"
The tiny hairs on my arms stood straight up. Time seemed to slow as I looked down at the boy in my arms—Ash Ketchum, the hero of countless anime episodes I'd watched in my previous life. The would-be Pokemon Master. The kid who was supposed to meet Pikachu, travel across regions, make lifelong friends.
Now he was just a terrified child who'd watched his father's Pokemon burned alive.
"No," I whispered, the word escaping before I could stop it.
Dr. Fuji's face darkened instantly. "What?"
I kept my eyes fixed on Ash's trembling form, avoiding Dr. Fuji's gaze. My mind raced, searching desperately for something—anything—to say that might calm him down, that might get us out of this alive. Maybe if I pretended to cooperate? If I went with him, would he leave Ash alone?
But as I looked at the charred remains of Electabuzz, I knew the truth. There was no reasoning with this man. No scenario where this ended well. And even if I cooperated, would I want to live under a crazed murderer like that?
A strange calm washed over me. I'd already died once, after all. Hit by a truck while chasing a digital Mewtwo. What was one more death?
This world—this hell where Pokemon weren't cute, approachable creatures but deadly weapons in the hands of monsters like Dr. Fuji—wasn't the world I'd dreamed of.
The world I'd escaped to whenever my parents hovered over my shoulder, demanding another hour of studying, another perfect test score. 
"Those games are for boys," they'd say, confiscating my Pokemon cartridges while shoving me into any random supplementary classes they could find.
But I'd always found ways to sneak back to that colorful world where children were heroes and monsters were friends.
Maybe this was my punishment. A twisted afterlife designed to torment me for every rebellious moment, for every hour I spent playing games instead of studying, for failing to be the perfect daughter they wanted. The universe's cruel joke: trapping me in a nightmarish version of the very world that had once been my sanctuary.
I lifted my gaze to meet Dr. Fuji's, no longer trying to hide my disgust.
"I'm not your daughter," I said, my voice stronger than I expected. "I never was."
"What are you talking about?" he asked, his voice tightening as he took a step closer. Confusion flickered across his face.
"Delia was right," I continued, pulling Ash tighter against me. "I’m not Amber. Your ‘experiment’ was a failure."
I paused, letting the words sink in before I added with a chuckle, “You’re a failure. A failure of a scientist, a husband, a father.”
His face contorted with rage, but I kept going, the words spilling out now.
"When you tried to clone Amber, you somehow pulled me into her body instead—a twenty-year-old woman from another world entirely. I died, and then I woke up in your lab." I gave a bitter laugh. "I've been wearing her dresses, living in her house, pretending to be your daughter. But I'm not her. I never was. I never will be.”
I met his eyes directly and chuckled maniacally, "All this time, you've been dressing a complete stranger in your dead daughter's clothes. Think about how fucked up that is. You've been obsessing over some random woman you pulled from who knows where, forcing me into this... this sick fantasy of yours."
"You're confused," he said, but uncertainty flickered in his eyes. "The cloning process—"
A deafening boom thundered behind Dr. Fuji, cutting through whatever his next words were going to be.
He snapped around, his entire body pivoting sharply toward the sound—and in that split second while his back was turned, a massive orange shape smashed into the ground in front of me and Ash, an old man in a white lab coat clutching the orange shape’s neck.
