story_description: | 
  Pokemon fan gets isekai'd to the Pokemon world as a little girl.

  Join Dr. Fuji's apparently successful clone, as she explores this mishmash of Pokemon media and other creative liberties and grittier world.

  What to expect:

  - a grittier and more "realistic" Pokemon world (but also more different and more expansive)

  - mix of action and drama

  - some pretty serious elements including but not limited to: mental health, death, trauma, etc.
