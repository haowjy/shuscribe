I have a current request to update a comprehensive wiki document for a Pokemon fanfiction story called \"Pokemon: Ambertwo\" with new information from the latest chapter. The story seems to involve a Pokemon fan being reincarnated (or \"isekai'd\") into the Pokemon world as Dr. Fuji's daughter, Amber.\n\nThe latest chapter provides a lot of new information about:\n1. Amber's existential struggles with her new identity and body\n2. Her fears about Team Rocket\n3. Her memories of her past life\n4. More environmental details about Cinnabar Island\n5. A new travel segment involving flying on Pidgeot to Celadon City\n\nLet me structure a comprehensive wiki document that integrates this new information seamlessly. I'll need to:\n- Create logical sections that cover the story elements\n- Use wiki-links to cross-reference entities\n- Ensure it reads as a cohesive document, not just a chapter summary\n- Focus on facts and events, not analysis\n- Structure with proper markdown headings\n\nI'll need to organize topics in a way that makes sense for a wiki, not necessarily chronologically by chapter.</ANTHROPIC_THINKING><|STARTWIKI|>\n\n## World Overview\n\n### The [[Pokemon]] World\n\nThe world of Pokemon: Ambertwo appears to be a complex fusion of various Pokemon media, including elements from the games, anime, and manga. This world contains actual, living Pokemon with significant physical presence and impact. The regions follow similar geography to the canonical Pokemon world, with locations like [[Cinnabar Island]] and [[Celadon City]] being key areas in the narrative.\n\nTransportation in this world utilizes Pokemon in practical ways. The [[Celadon Express]] is a flight service that uses multiple [[Pidgeot]] for passenger transport between islands and cities. This service demonstrates how flying Pokemon are integrated into society for practical purposes beyond battling.\n\n### [[Team Rocket]]\n\nTeam Rocket operates with significant resources and influence. They maintain secret laboratories for genetic experimentation, including the facility where [[Dr. Fuji]] worked on creating [[Mewtwo]]. Following Mewtwo's escape, they represent a looming threat, with their potential pursuit of both Mewtwo and knowledge of any surviving experiments.\n\n## Key Characters\n\n### [[Amber (Reincarnated)]]\n\nThe protagonist of the story is a reincarnated Pokemon fan who now inhabits the body of [[Dr. Fuji]]'s daughter, Amber. Formerly an adult Pokemon enthusiast in the real world, she died while playing Pokemon GO and found herself awakening in a clone tank in Dr. Fuji's laboratory. Her consciousness now resides in the body of a 10-year-old girl with mint-green hair.\n\nAmber struggles significantly with her new identity, experiencing severe [[Existential Dread]] as she tries to reconcile her adult mind with her child body. She feels guilt knowing she occupies the body meant for Dr. Fuji's deceased daughter, describing herself as \"an accident of consciousness in a form that should have failed.\" Her fingerprints, body movements, and even breathing feel foreign to her.\n\nShe retains memories of her past life, including her mother, her cat (nicknamed Snorlax), collecting Pokemon cards during lockdown, and playing Pokemon games. Her final moments involved a Pokemon battle using a Gyarados named Tsunami before being hit by a truck.\n\nAmber possesses meta-knowledge about the Pokemon world from her previous life, understanding different potential timelines from the games, anime, and manga. This knowledge causes her anxiety about Team Rocket potentially discovering and exploiting both her and her knowledge.\n\n### [[Dr. Fuji]]\n\nA middle-aged scientist and Amber's father in her new life. He is emotionally invested in Amber, showing deep care and protection toward her. Dr. Fuji was responsible for creating [[Mewtwo]] and apparently succeeded in cloning his deceased daughter, though the consciousness inhabiting the clone's body is not his original daughter's.\n\nHe serves as a source of stability for Amber, adjusting her safety straps during their Pidgeot flight and generally looking after her welfare. His primary motivation appears to be protecting Amber and rebuilding their life together after the chaos of Mewtwo's escape.\n\n### [[Mewtwo]]\n\nA powerful Psychic-type Pokemon created through genetic engineering by Dr. Fuji. Mewtwo escaped from Dr. Fuji's laboratory in a destructive rampage that forced Dr. Fuji and Amber to flee. Described as raw, primal, and terrifyingly real with unstable form and immense power.\n\nWhen Mewtwo made eye contact with Amber during its escape, there appeared to be a flicker of recognition. Amber reflects that Mewtwo is \"another consciousness that never should have been,\" though she notes that at least Mewtwo was created with a clear purpose: to be the most powerful Pokemon in existence.\n\nAmber contemplates the different possible futures for Mewtwo based on various Pokemon media, including it being captured by Team Rocket, escaping to Cerulean Cave, or following other canonical storylines.\n\n## Locations\n\n### [[Dr. Fuji's Laboratory]]\n\nAn underground facility where Amber awakened in a tank filled with amber fluid. The laboratory contained equipment for Pokemon experimentation, including multiple tanks similar to Amber's. The facility was located beneath Cinnabar Island, hidden from the knowledge of tourists and regular visitors to the island.\n\nDuring Mewtwo's escape, the laboratory was severely damaged when Mewtwo blasted through the ceiling to escape.\n\n### [[Cinnabar Island]]\n\nA volcanic island that serves as a tourist destination, with visitors typically unaware of the secret laboratory beneath it. The island features black volcanic sand beaches and a visible volcano silhouette. After escaping the laboratory, Amber and Dr. Fuji stayed at a hotel on the island before arranging transportation to leave.\n\n## Events\n\n### Awakening and Escape\n\nAmber awakened in a tank filled with amber fluid, initially confused about her situation. As she gained awareness, she realized she had been reincarnated into the Pokemon world as Dr. Fuji's daughter. During this disorientation, Mewtwo also awoke and escaped in a destructive rampage, forcing Amber and Dr. Fuji to flee the laboratory.\n\n### Journey to [[Celadon City]]\n\nAfter spending a night in a hotel on Cinnabar Island, Amber and Dr. Fuji joined other passengers for the [[Celadon Express]], a Pokemon air transport service. The service uses a formation of eight [[Pidgeot]] escorted by a [[Fearow]] and a [[Noctowl]], all under the command of Captain Lin and Captain Reed.\n\nAmber experienced her first direct contact with Pokemon during this journey, riding on a Pidgeot named [[Pidgeot (Storm)|Storm]]. The encounter left her awestruck as she reconciled the reality of actual Pokemon with her previous understanding of them as fictional creatures. Despite her excitement, exhaustion eventually overtook her, and she fell asleep during the flight, comforted by the rhythm of Storm's wings and Dr. Fuji's protective presence.\n\n## Ongoing Conflicts\n\n### Internal Identity Struggle\n\nAmber experiences significant internal conflict as she adjusts to her new existence. She struggles with insomnia due to fear that sleep might cause her to lose her connection to her former self. She grapples with feeling like an imposter in Amber's body, viewing herself as \"an accident\" rather than the intended consciousness for this form.\n\nHer existential questions expand to include wondering about her purpose in this world, especially in comparison to Mewtwo who was created with the clear purpose of being the strongest Pokemon.\n\n### Threat of [[Team Rocket]]\n\nThough not immediately present after their escape from the laboratory, Team Rocket represents a significant looming threat. Amber worries about what they might do if they discover a \"failed experiment walking around with a head full of meta knowledge.\" Her awareness of multiple possible timelines from different Pokemon media adds complexity to her concern about Team Rocket's future actions.\n\n<|ENDWIKI|>",
