# ShuScribe Frontend Implementation Status

**"Cursor for Fiction Writing" - MVP Development Progress**

*Last Updated: January 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

ShuScribe is a context-aware fiction writing platform targeting the MVP phase. The frontend is built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tiptap editor, implementing a three-panel VS Code-like workspace. The core value proposition is the @-reference system for context-aware writing assistance.

## What's Missing ‚ùå

### 1. @-Reference System (CRITICAL MVP GAP)
**Status: Not Implemented - Core Differentiator**

This is the most important missing piece for MVP launch:

**Required Implementation:**
- **ProseMirror plugin**: Detect `@` character and trigger autocomplete
- **Local project index**: Build searchable index from all project documents
- **Fuzzy search**: Client-side instant search through documents and tags
- **Reference node type**: Custom ProseMirror nodes for `@characters/elara`
- **Tag system**: Document tagging for thematic organization
- **Reference validation**: Detect broken links and maintain integrity
- **Navigation**: Click references to open linked documents

**Technical Approach:**
```typescript
// Example reference types needed:
@characters/protagonists/elara  // File references
@fire-magic                     // Tag references
@locations/mystical/temple      // Hierarchical paths
```

**Impact**: Without this system, ShuScribe lacks its core value proposition

### 2. Backend Integration
**Status: Not Implemented**

**Required API Endpoints:**
- `GET /projects/{id}/data` - Load complete project data
- `POST/PUT/DELETE /documents` - Document CRUD operations
- `POST /projects/{id}/references/validate` - Reference integrity checking
- Authentication endpoints for Supabase integration

### 3. File Operations
**Status: Placeholder Functions Only**

**Missing Functionality:**
- Create new documents and folders
- Rename/move documents with reference updating
- Delete documents with dependency checking
- Import existing documents
- Export project data

### 4. Search & Navigation
**Status: Not Implemented**

**Missing Features:**
- Global project search across all documents
- Content-based search within documents
- Reference navigation and backlinks
- Recent files and favorites

### 5. Real AI Integration
**Status: Mock Only**

**Future Implementation:**
- OpenAI/Anthropic API integration
- Context-aware writing assistance
- Character development suggestions
- Plot consistency checking

## Conclusion

The ShuScribe frontend has a **strong foundation** with excellent workspace UX, robust editor functionality, and well-architected components. The main gap is the **@-reference system**, which is the core differentiator but not yet implemented.

**Key Strengths:**
- Professional workspace UI that matches user expectations
- Solid technical architecture with modern React patterns
- Comprehensive editor system ready for extension
- Strong component library and design system

**Critical Missing Piece:**
- The @-reference system is the make-or-break feature for MVP
- Without it, ShuScribe is just another text editor
- Implementation is well-planned but requires focused development effort

**Recommendation**: Focus development entirely on the @-reference system and backend integration to achieve MVP launch readiness. The UI foundation is production-ready and will showcase the core value proposition effectively once the reference system is operational.
