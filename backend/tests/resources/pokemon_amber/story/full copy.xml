<Chapter title="[Chapter 11] Pallet Town" file="story/11.txt">
Today's dress hung on my closet door like a ghost. Plain white cotton instead of the usual frills and lace, with just a simple red ribbon at the neck. The sight of it made my stomach turn. After weeks of Dr. Fuji's obsession with making me wear elaborate dresses, this simple white one felt deliberate. Wrong. Like he was dressing me for a specific role, though I couldn't quite remember where I'd seen it before.
The apartment air pressed down, stale with unsaid things. Ditto stood by my door, a perfect mirror of that first day—before the mini-adventures, the battle, the taste of friendship in this world.
"Good morning?" I tried.
Silence. Just yesterday we'd celebrated my first reward, a handful of suddenly meaningless coins. Now Ditto just… watched. Back to being the proper guardian. A wall between us.
In the kitchen, wrongness piled up. Cold tea in a forgotten mug. An empty chair where Dr. Fuji should be. And there, the empty space by the kettle where Ditto's Pokeball used to sit, a glaring absence.
Would anyone notice I was gone? Mary, Kaede, Erika—our whirlwind adventure felt like a lifetime ago, but it had only been a day. We hadn't made concrete plans, but surely they'd wonder where I'd disappeared to. Wouldn't they?
I poked at soggy cereal, too aware of Ditto watching from the doorway. "So... about yesterday—"
Nothing. Not a ripple. Just that steady, neutral gaze that made my skin prickle. I forced down another sand-dry bite. Some reward. Trapped with a friend who couldn't be one anymore.
Watching Ditto's cold distance reminded me of another set of lost friends—the ones from my old life. 
My college friends were probably still reeling. No dramatic farewell, not even a proper game over screen—just me, a semi-truck, and that last desperate message about Shadow Mewtwo. Their final memory of me would be an empty dorm room and a string of "where are you?" texts that would never get answers.
The morning dragged on, an endless stretch of mindless channel surfing. Battle tournaments, contest highlights, documentaries on the migratory patterns of Beautifly... None of it could hold my interest. 
How could it, after the heart-pounding reality of my own battles? The rush of working in sync with Ditto, the pride of overcoming challenges together, the promise of a real bond—the TV offered only pale imitations. Just flashy spectacles without the personal stakes that had made my brief adventure feel so meaningful.
And through it all, Ditto watched me, still as a statue. No excited trills at the battles, no curious head tilts at the contests. Just that wary, too-knowing gaze. A silent reminder of how much had changed overnight.
The knock, when it finally came, shattered the suffocating silence. Dr. Fuji burst through the door, not waiting for a response. He'd shed his usual lab coat for a crisp brown vest over a neatly pressed button-down shirt. Despite the formal attire, there was something strange in his manner—a taut energy that made his usual composed demeanor feel like a mask about to slip.
"We're leaving." His voice had a strange, stretched quality I'd never heard before. Taut and thin, like a wire about to snap. "Flight leaves soon."
Without ceremony, he recalled Ditto. The Pokeball vanished into his pocket. Then his hand clamped around my wrist, hauling me out into the sudden bustle of the streets.
The Pidgeot Express field sprawled across what would have been prime Celadon real estate. No neat rows of houses here—just an expanse of trampled grass and wooden platforms where massive birds perched like living aircraft. 
The morning formation swooped overhead—seven Pidgeots cutting through dawn in perfect V-formation, each wingbeat sending visible ripples through the morning mist. A week ago, that sight had nearly brought me to tears. Now all I could think about was how each of those wings could generate hurricane-force winds with a single flap, how its razor-sharp beak could tear through flesh, and how the games never mentioned what happened to passengers who fell from the height of their flight.
Dr. Fuji pulled me through the barely-contained bedlam, his grip never loosening. "Looks like good weather at least," he remarked, but the lightness rang hollow. Forced. "Clear skies to Viridian."
Words lay fossilized on my tongue as he manhandled me into the harness, each buckle a tiny shackle. The liftoff ripped the air from my lungs, leaving my stomach far below.
I'd always imagined this—skimming through clouds, marveling at the bird's-eye view of the world below. But as Kanto smeared into a blur of color, a single morbid thought knocked around my skull: how many trainers had the unforgiving sky swallowed up, never to be seen again?
The question chased me long after we landed. Dr. Fuji hustled me through Viridian's winding streets, backtracking twice with a muttered curse. When he finally veered into a narrow alley, the car lot waiting at the end sent a fresh jolt of surprise through me.
Cars were a rarity in Celadon, and I'd barely spared them a glance, too caught up in the thrill of real Pokemon. But now, faced with the rusted husks slouching in this forgotten lot, I couldn't look away. They seemed to belong to another era entirely, all boxy frames and chrome grills as if from the 1950s.
After Dr. Fuji paid for a day’s rental, he yanked open the passenger door and ordered, “Get in.”
I eyed the cracked leather seats and the dust-filmed dashboard, wondering if this was some kind of elaborate prank. But Dr. Fuji's expression held no hint of humor as he drummed his fingers against the roof, his whole body coiled with barely suppressed agitation.
Swallowing my questions, I clambered into the passenger seat, wincing as the ancient springs dug into my back.
As the city gave way to rolling hills and dense forests, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were driving straight into the past. The car's radio dial was frozen on a station that crackled out staticky old jazz tunes, and every bump in the road rattled the frame like it was one pothole away from shaking apart entirely.
The southern road wound through rolling countryside, each hill revealing more of the landscape ahead. A laboratory complex appeared long before the town itself—a sprawling collection of windmills and research buildings perched atop the highest hill like something from a Studio Ghibli film. The setting sun painted the spinning blades in shades of amber and gold, their long shadows sweeping across the valley below like the hands of some giant clock counting down to... Pallet Town?
With its proximity to Viridian City and the iconic windmills of Professor Oak’s lab seemingly pulled from the cartoons, this was clearly Pallet Town.
My hands twisted in my lap as questions I'd been avoiding crashed through my mind: Why Pallet Town? Was this even the same timeline as the games? Or was it the anime? …Manga? Did Ash exist here? Red? Both? Neither?
 The reality of this world kept diverging further from everything I thought I knew, and each difference felt like another crack in whatever remained of my certainty.
The Town emerged gradually: first scattered farms, then clusters of houses, and finally the town proper. It was smaller than I'd imagined, barely more than a collection of homes wrapped around the base of Oak's lab’s hill.
We turned onto a narrow lane lined with neat gardens. A woman worked among the flower beds, and for a moment I didn't recognize her. But her auburn hair, pink dress and dirt-stained apron, along with being in pallet town—this was obviously Delia Ketchum.
The car's brakes squealed. Before I could process the scene, Dr. Fuji's hand found my arm, pulling me from the car. Gravel crunched under my feet as I stumbled.
In the yard, a dark-haired boy played with a Poliwag, his laughter carrying in the evening air. I froze—I knew that face from countless episodes, but seeing Ash Ketchum as a young child felt wrong.
Or... was this Red? The Poliwag made me doubt everything I thought I knew. The manga version had a Poliwag, didn't he? But that was definitely Delia in the garden, so this had to be Ash. Unless this was some weird timeline where—
A twig snapped under Dr. Fuji's shoe. The woman turned, brushing hair from her face with soil-stained fingers. For a moment, her expression was simply curious. Then her eyes found Dr. Fuji, and recognition crawled across her face like an advancing shadow.
"Delia." Dr. Fuji's voice cracked on the name like thin ice. "It's... it's been a while."
I watched the woman at the garden freeze, trowel suspended mid-motion. This was Delia—Ash Ketchum's mother—but something was wrong. In all my hours of Pokemon games and shows, I'd never heard of any connection between her and Dr. Fuji. The garden tool trembled in her grip, dark soil falling like black snow.
Even the boy and his Poliwag had gone quiet, sensing the shift in atmosphere.
"I brought—" He pushed me forward like a prize specimen. "I brought her back. I did it, Delia. I brought our daughter back."
The garden tools lay forgotten among the flowers, their shadows stretching long across the carefully tended earth. In the dying light, I watched Delia's face go completely still, as if she'd forgotten how to breathe. Her eyes fixed on me with an expression I couldn't read—something between disbelief and dawning horror.
"You actually did it," she whispered, and there was something terrible in her voice, like she was seeing every fear she'd ever had come true at once. "After all these years, you actually—"
The sound of running water cut off abruptly inside. A chair scraped against wood, followed by the bang of a screen door. A man burst onto the porch, sleeves rolled up and hands still dripping soap suds.
The boy—Ash? Red?—snapped out of his frozen state, the tension sliding right off him. "Dad! Come look at what Poliwag learned today!"
His father's eyes never left us as he descended the worn wooden steps of the porch, each creak underlining the tension. Even with soap suds still clinging to his arms, there was nothing domestic about his expression as he watched these uninvited ghosts invade his dooryard.
Twenty years of anime episodes where he simply didn't exist, and here he was washing dishes. Something about that felt more wrong than right.
The Poliwag splashed in a puddle, oblivious to the growing storm. Delia's voice cut through the evening air, quiet but firm: "Ash, take Poliwag inside."
"But Mom—"
"Now, please."
I watched him hesitate, caught in that peculiar childhood moment of sensing adult tension without understanding its source. After what felt like forever, he scooped up his Poliwag and trudged toward the house, trailing water with each step.
"Who are you?" Ash's father moved to stand beside his wife, positioning himself between us and the house. Water dripped steadily from his rolled sleeves onto the freshly turned earth.
Dr. Fuji's fingers dug deeper into my shoulder. "This doesn't concern you." His voice had taken on a strange, dreamy quality that made my skin crawl. "You've played your part, offering comfort while I was away. But now I've succeeded. Our daughter—" he pushed me forward again, "—is back. We can be a proper family again. A brilliant family. Not this..." he gestured at the modest blue house, the neat rows of flowers, "...pastoral mediocrity."
The garden tools lay scattered where Delia had dropped them, their metal surfaces catching the last rays of sunlight. She stood very still, and I wondered if this was how she'd looked when Dr. Fuji first told her about his plans to clone their daughter—that perfect balance between fury and heartbreak.
"Pastoral mediocrity?" Her voice trembled with the weight of years. "While you were hiding in your lab trying to play god, I built something real. Something whole." She swept her arm toward the cheerful blue house behind her, the carefully tended garden beds, the wooden swing hanging from the old oak tree. "But you wouldn't understand that, would you? Some of us chose to live instead of—"
"I brought her back!" Dr. Fuji's grip tightened until I had to bite back a wince. "She's alive, Delia. Our daughter is alive again. Look at her face, her eyes—it's her, it has to be her—"
"That's not—that’s not Amber." Delia's words fell like broken glass. "Whatever you've done, whatever you've created..." She forced herself to look at me, really look, like someone pressing on a bruise to prove it hurts. When she finally spoke again, her voice cracked. "Our daughter is gone, and this—" her hand trembled as she gestured at me, "this is just another experiment. Another way to avoid facing what happened. The cancer—"
That word—cancer—carried the weight of years of grief. The setting sun caught in her hair, painting her in shades of gold that made the whole scene feel like some twisted memorial photo.
A breeze stirred the flowers, carrying the scent of freshly turned earth and something that might have been dinner cooking inside that cheerful blue house. Some other version of this evening existed where they'd all be sitting down to eat right now, if we hadn't shown up to shatter their peace.
Dr. Fuji's fingers dug so deep into my shoulder that I could feel each individual digit trembling. Not with grief or shame, but with that particular kind of desperate anger that comes when someone's carefully constructed reality starts to crack. "You don't understand," he said, his voice rising to match the wind. "I did it. I actually did it! While you were here playing house with—" he released my shoulder to jab a finger at Ash's father, "—with some lab assistant," he spat the words like they tasted foul, "I brought our daughter back! I did what everyone said was impossible! This is what I promised you, what you never believed I could—"
"Get off my property." Delia's voice cut through his rant like a knife. Her shadow stretched long across her garden, merging with the darkness gathering at the edges of this broken family tableau. "Before I call Officer Jenny."
The silence stretched between them like a thread pulled too tight. I looked up at Dr. Fuji, watching shadows crawl across his face as the sun sank lower, dreading the moment something—
His hand suddenly lifted from my shoulder. The absence of pressure was so unexpected I stumbled slightly, catching myself just as he spun on his heel. No words, no final desperate plea—he simply stormed back to the car in sharp, angry steps that sent gravel flying.
The engine roared to life, gears protesting as he threw it into reverse. Only then did it hit me: he was leaving. Actually leaving me here, surrounded by the fragments of a family I both did and didn't know, in a world that kept refusing to match my memories. 
First my old life, then Ditto, and now even the man who'd caused all of this—all of them slipping away like water through cupped hands.
I stood frozen, conflicted, in the lengthening shadows of Delia's garden, listening to the sound of tires on dirt fade into the distance.

<Chapter title="[Chapter 12] A Very Reasonable Man" file="story/12.txt">
A winding path cut through the trees on Pallet Town's outskirts. Dr. Fuji fidgeted on a fallen log, where he’d spent the afternoon, a manila folder gripped tightly in his lap.
Through the branches, Oak's lab silhouetted against the afternoon sky. Champion Oak. Professor Oak now. The grant ceremony seemed a lifetime ago—Oak's firm handshake, flashing cameras, admiring looks. 
Yet here Dr. Fuji sat, overshadowed while Oak transitioned from victory to victory, as if remaking a life were as simple as a title change.
He spread the folder’s contents across the damp bark: surveillance reports from Domino mixed with photos old and new. The older ones, soft-edged from years of handling, showed happier times—their wedding day, beach trips with little Amber building sandcastles, family picnics in the summer sun.
The newer photos captured Delia around her restaurant, in her garden, and walking through town. His fingers trembled slightly as he sifted through them. He found a few that stood out: Delia laughing at her garden gate, Stephen's arm draped her shoulders.
"Just a reasonable discussion," he muttered, taking out his pen. The ink moved methodically across Stephen's face. "Man to man. You must understand that Delia and I..." His hand pressed harder, the pen tip catching on the glossy surface. “We kind of have a history.”
Another photo. Stephen and Delia at some local festival together. His pen dug into the paper, scratching violently until it tore through. "I'm not being unreasonable." The next one—their garden. His fingers seized the edge of Stephen's figure and ripped, the sound sharp in the quiet afternoon. "I just need you to understand..." He was tearing them now, hands shaking as pieces fell around his feet like strange confetti. "...that you're in the way of something bigger than yourself."
A young trainer passed by with her Rattata, giving him an uncertain glance before hurrying on. The sound of footsteps pulled Dr. Fuji from his frenzy, and he quickly gathered the scattered pieces, stuffing them back into the folder. 
His hands steadied as he checked his watch. Soon. Stephen took this path to the lab, so he’ll probably take the same path back. Just two reasonable men, having a discussion about Delia's future.
The shadows had shifted since dawn, when he'd first noticed Stephen walking this path. Dr. Fuji's legs had gone numb hours ago, but he barely registered the discomfort. 
Last night's confrontation in Delia's garden replayed incessantly, each memory morphing into something more twisted. Her accusations of "trying to play god," her dismissal of his life's work as just "another experiment," the disdain she'd looked at Amber like she was a mere thing instead of their daughter—it all twisted into something darker with each echo. And that final command to leave their property? As if he were just some stranger disrupting her perfect little life with her lab assistant.
He'd been tenured at Celadon University while Stephen was probably still fumbling with undergraduate chemistry sets, pioneering genetic research while this... this lab assistant was likely still trying to memorize the basic type chart.
He'd spent the day here, watching Oak's lab through the trees, watching the path, shuffling through his photos until the edges went soft.
That cheerful blue house of hers, with its wooden swing and carefully tended garden beds, kept swimming before his eyes. Such pastoral mediocrity. Yet she'd chosen that—chosen Stephen—over everything he'd accomplished, everything he'd promised her he'd do.
The sound of footsteps along gravel pulled him from his spiral. Stephen was right on schedule, probably heading home to make dinner in that cozy kitchen. The sight of him sent a wave of static through Dr. Fuji's mind, drowning out the words he'd rehearsed all day. His hand found a Pokeball in his pocket, fingers trembling slightly.
"Hey." Dr. Fuji’s voice broke as he stepped onto the path. "We need to talk about Delia."
Stephen stopped, briefcase shifting in his grip. His expression was guarded, but not yet afraid. 
"Dr. Fuji." He spoke like someone approaching a wounded Pokémon. "What you're doing with that child... Delia told me everything about Amber. About what happened. I understand what you went through, but—"
"Understand?" The word tasted like acid. "You understand?" Dr. Fuji's hand tightened around the Pokeball. The static in his head crescendoed, drowning out whatever patronizing comfort this lab assistant thought he could offer. "I was reconstructing genetic sequences while you were still learning how to operate a centrifuge. I brought our daughter back while you were... what? Filing reports? Cleaning test tubes?"
"Sir, please." Stephen set his briefcase down slowly, his hand moving toward his neck, but paused as he felt nothing. "You're not thinking clearly. Why don't we—"
"I brought her back!" The words burst out of him. "I did what no one else could do, what they said was impossible. And now you... you dare to judge me? To stand there in what should be my house, with my wife, while my daughter..."
His hands clenched into claws at his sides, tendons bulging. For a moment, only his ragged breathing filled the air. When he spoke again, his voice stripped bare of any pretense.
"Ditto!" The Pokéball arced through the air, exploding with red light, and releasing a small pink blob. "Protocol Five."
The pink blob erupted upward like a geyser, twisting and contorting until a massive serpentine form blocked out the afternoon sun.
Stephen stumbled backward, fumbling in his pockets for a Pokéball. "Poliwag, help—"
The tiny tadpole materialized, looking pitifully fragile under Ditto-Gyarados's coiled form. A tremor shook the great serpent's body—hesitation, or resistance?—but Dr. Fuji's next words cut through the air like a knife:
"Dragon Rage."
The pink-purple flames roared through the evening air. The Poliwag tried to dodge, but the attack's ferocity left nowhere to go. The blast engulfed the area, kicking up dust and debris.
Pink-purple flames roared through the evening air, superheating the atmosphere with a thunderous crack. The Poliwag tried to dodge, its tiny legs scrambling against scorched earth, but the attack's ferocity left nowhere to go. The blast engulfed the area with a small explosion, sending debris and superheated air rolling outward in a devastating wave.
When the dust cleared, Poliwag lay motionless in a scorched crater. Stephen was already running forward, reaching for his fallen Pokemon. "Poliwag! Are you—"
"Hyper Beam."
Ditto-Gyarados's massive form shuddered. For a heartbeat, its eyes met Stephen's—and in them was something almost human. The great serpentine body coiled backward, resisting.
"I said Hyper Beam!" Dr. Fuji's voice cracked with hysteria as he pointed towards the only obstacle remaining. "NOW!"
Another heartbeat of resistance—scales trembling, eyes squeezed shut—then a white-hot beam erupted from its maw.
The blinding light of Hyper Beam carved a trench through the earth. As the devastating attack subsided, the forest path transformed into a scorched corridor shrouded in darkness. Steam wafted from the charred ground, and the acrid tang of ozone pervaded the air.
Ditto-Gyarados wavered, its massive form beginning to lose cohesion as patches of pink showed through the blue scales. Dr. Fuji walked forward through the devastation, shoes crunching on scorched earth. He stopped at the edge of the impact zone, where Stephen's body lay crumpled beside Poliwag.
His foot nudged the man and the small tadpole Pokemon. He briefly glanced back at the giant serpentine monster behind him, annoyance clearly visible on his face. "Ditto. Why did you hold back? Finish them. Bite."
The great serpentine form shuddered, scales rippling as Ditto fought against the command. Its eyes, still holding that terrible awareness, squeezed shut.
Silence stretched between them, broken only by the soft crackle of burning grass.
"I... created... you." Dr. Fuji whispered dangerously. Ditto's form wavered further, pink seeping through the scales as its transformation began to collapse. "You exist because of me. How dare you defy me now?"
The great serpentine form trembled, then began to shrink, refusing the command. Dr. Fuji's face twisted with rage as he raised the Pokeball.
"Useless." His hand shook as he recalled the Ditto. "Mewtwo killed twenty-three of Team Rocket’s best scientists the moment it awoke. But you act like you're a…”
He stared down at Ditto's Pokeball for a long moment, something flickering behind his eyes. Then his other hand moved to a different ball, and whatever had passed across his face vanished completely.
"Magmar." His voice was steady now, almost serene. The fire Pokemon materialized in a flash of red light, its flame-wreathed form casting dancing shadows across the scorched earth. "Incinerate the bodies. Leave nothing."
The Magmar's flames ignited instantly, no hesitation, no flicker of doubt—just pure mechanical obedience. Its maw opened, and blue-white fire roared forth with devastating intensity.
Dr. Fuji watched dispassionately, hands clasped behind his back, as Magmar's flames devoured the fallen Stephen and Poliwag.
He brushed some ash from his sleeve. "Unfortunate, but necessary." He spoke softly to himself as he turned away. "I'll need to console Delia. She'll understand. She has to."
The late afternoon sun cast long shadows as he drove through Pallet Town's dirt paths. Nearing Delia's house, he caught a glimpse of her through the hedgerow—kneeling in the garden, meticulously tending her flower beds.
Dr. Fuji's hands tightened on the steering wheel, then deliberately relaxed. No, this wasn't right. Not like this, still smelling of smoke. Delia deserved better. This was, after all, a reunion.
As he watched her tend the garden, memories of their university days flooded back. He'd spent months in the greenhouse, painstakingly cross-breeding varieties until he created the perfect hybrid dahlia—a delicate pink bloom with golden-tipped petals spiraling inward like a mathematical dream, made just for her. When he proposed, the entire conservatory was filled with them.
He'd failed her then, somehow. Been too absorbed in his work, perhaps. Not presented himself properly. But now... now he could do things right.
He drove past without slowing. First, he needed better clothes. Maybe some of the best wine. And dahlias. Were there any in Pallet Town? If not, surely the florists in Viridian City would have something suitable. He could return later, properly dressed and prepared. Do things right this time. Do things right again.
Behind him, in the distance, a column of smoke still rose from the forest path near Oak's laboratory.

<Chapter title="[Chapter 13] Sweet Home" file="story/13.txt">
As the sound of tires on dirt faded into the distance, Stephen placed a gentle but firm hand on my shoulder. He guided me into the house, past a worn lab coat hanging like a ghost on the wall. The house smelled of curry and clean laundry—so different from the artificial sterility of Dr. Fuji's apartment that my steps faltered.
A display case mounted above the fireplace caught my eye: eight badges gleaming under glass, arranged with care. Below them, Ash had spread cards—Pokemon Cards?—across the coffee table in a matching pattern, Poliwag waddling between the neat rows with surprising care.
"Sit," Stephen said from the kitchen doorway. I could hear Delia continue her work outside, the soft snip of shears punctuating the evening quiet. "Are you hungry? We have leftover curry."
My first instinct was to refuse politely. But my stomach had other ideas, reminding me that my last meal had been that sad bowl of soggy cereal this morning. Dr. Fuji hadn't exactly prioritized lunch during his dramatic family reunion planning.
Stephen chuckled as he heard my stomach growl.
Without a proper response from me, he shuffled to the fridge to pull two containers from the fridge—curry in one, perfectly packed rice in the other. As he leaned in, a Pokeball swung free from his shirt collar, hanging from a worn chain around his neck.
Steam still fogged the lids, suggesting dinner had only recently ended. As he assembled the plate, rich spices filled the air with the kind of homemade comfort that Dr. Fuji's apartment had never known.
"It might need reheating, It’s been in the fridge for a bit," Stephen said, studying my face with genuine concern. "Delia says the curry needs to be properly hot to bring out the flavors. Unless you prefer it this way?"
I shrugged, watching as he placed the plate in the microwave.
Through the kitchen window, I could see Delia's shadow stretching across her garden beds, growing longer as the sun sank lower.
As the plate rotated slowly behind the glass, my eyes drifted to those badges gleaming above the fireplace. The question slipped out before I could stop it: "Were you a trainer?"
Stephen's hand briefly touched something under his shirt collar before dropping away. "A lifetime ago," he said quietly, something haunted crossing his face.
"What happened?" The question slipped out before I could stop myself.
His eyes lifted to the badge display's reflection in the kitchen window. For a moment, something raw and grief-stricken crossed his face. Then he shook his head, shoulders slumping slightly. "I wasn't a good enough trainer back then. But I think now we…"
His voice trailed off into nothing, leaving only the steady hum of the microwave to fill the kitchen's sudden silence.
The microwave dinged. Stephen set the steaming plate in front of me, then rolled his sleeves back up, returning to the sink where soap suds climbed toward his elbows as he tackled what looked like a particularly stubborn pot.
The curry was surprisingly good—far better than I'd expected. Something about restaurants in Pallet Town tugged at my memory, but the thought dissolved before I could grasp it. 
What remained was simply this: each bite carried layers of flavor that spoke of careful preparation, of someone taking the time to toast spices and slow-cook onions until they practically melted.
When I finished, Stephen dried his hands and reached into a high cabinet. "Here," he said, offering me the cookie with a gentle smile. "You look like you could use something sweet."
"Hey!" A young voice made me jump. Ash stood in the kitchen doorway, Poliwag peering around his legs. "That's not fair! Mom said I couldn't have any cookies tonight! Why does she get them!" 
"Ash," Stephen started, but Ash was already moving closer, curiosity overtaking his initial protest. "Ash, that’s because you and Poliwag tracked mud into—let her—"
"Who are you anyway?" Ash demanded, turning to me. "Why're you eating our cookies?”
"Poli pol!" Poliwag added, waddling over to investigate the cookie crumbs.
I looked down at the cookie, then at Ash's frown, then back at the cookie. I carefully broke it in half—not quite even, giving him the slightly bigger piece.
"Here," I said, holding out half. I internally struggled with myself, wanting to take my hand back and eat it all. Dr. Fuji didn’t really have many sweets in his apartment. But I was an adult. "Want… to share?"
Ash's eyes widened, anger forgotten in the face of cookie diplomacy. He glanced at Stephen, who hesitated, eyes flickering to where Delia worked in the garden before giving a small, almost conspiratorial nod.
"Thanks!" Ash dropped into the chair next to me, cookie already halfway to his mouth. "I'm Ash, and that's Poliwag. He's not officially mine yet 'cause I'm not old enough, but he will be. What's your name?"
The cookie turned to dust in my mouth. Such a simple question—the kind you're supposed to answer without thinking. But my name... was it the one from college? From my previous life? The identity Dr. Fuji had tried to force on me? Or something new entirely?
Through the window, I could see Delia's shadow growing longer across her flowerbeds. The evening light caught her garden shears, making them flash like warning signals as she worked.
"She's had a long day, Ash," Stephen cut in smoothly, saving me from drowning in my own thoughts. "Why don't you tell her about that new move you've been teaching Poliwag instead?"
"Oh man, you should see what Poliwag can do!" Ash practically vibrated with excitement, previous cookie crimes forgotten. "We've been practicing Water Gun for weeks! Well, mostly inside 'cause of the rain, which is why we're in trouble, but—" He bounced up from his chair. "Can I show her, Dad? Please? Just a tiny demonstration?"
"Outside only," Stephen said firmly, though I caught the hint of a smile. "And aim away from your mother's flowers."
"Yes! Come on!" Ash was already heading for the door, Poliwag bouncing excitedly at his heels. He turned back when he reached the door, practically vibrating with eagerness. "You coming?"
“Sure,” I said as I followed them out, cookie crumbs still sticking to my fingers like tiny breadcrumbs marking my path.
Delia straightened from her flower beds as we passed, her hands stilling on her shears. The metal caught the dying light, flashing orange-red like a warning. Her eyes followed us, carrying the weight of questions I couldn't answer.
Ash charged ahead to a worn patch of grass beyond the garden, Poliwag bouncing at his heels. Behind us, Stephen paused beside Delia, their voices dropping too low to hear.
The worn patch of grass beyond the flower beds told its own story: muddy spots and small pools marking endless attempts at mastering Water Gun, still visible even in the failing light.
"Okay, Poliwag!" Ash threw his arms wide with childish drama. 
Poliwag was already bouncing forward, too excited to wait for actual commands. The Water Gun burst out in an enthusiastic but uncontrolled spray, sending both of us scrambling backward, laughing.
"See? I told you he was strong!" Ash bounced in place, rain-soaked but grinning. "Dad's been helping us practice aim, but Poliwag gets too excited sometimes. Right, buddy?"
"Poli!" The Pokemon nodded enthusiastically, sending water droplets flying.
"How long have you been training together?" I asked while chuckling. Strange to think this was the same Ash who would someday face down legendary Pokemon without flinching.
"Three whole months!" He dropped down beside Poliwag, scratching under its chin. "Since the river incident. Poliwag tried to save me, and Dad caught him after." His voice held that peculiar pride kids get when telling stories about their own near-disasters. "Now we train here where it's safe. Plus, Dad says it's good practice—Poliwag's gonna be my official starter once I'm old enough!"
"I'm gonna be the greatest Pokemon Master ever!" Ash declared between Water Gun attempts, fist pumped toward the orange sky. "Once I'm old enough, me and Poliwag will travel everywhere and I’ll catch 'em all!"
"Poli pol!" Poliwag bounced proudly, agreeing with Ash.
Behind us, I heard Stephen and Delia talking in low voices. Their words were lost to the evening breeze, probably discussing me. 
I focused instead on Ash's increasingly chaotic "special moves" demonstration, each attempt ending in more splashing and laughter.
"I'm gonna be the greatest Pokemon Master ever!" Ash declared between Water Gun attempts, fist pumped toward the orange sky. "Once I'm old enough, me and Poliwag will travel everywhere and catch 'em all!"
The sunset painted everything in deepening shades of orange, turning water droplets into tiny prisms as they caught the light. Looking at this soaking wet kid with impossible dreams, I couldn't help but smile. 
Someday he really would become the Pokemon Master and inspire countless trainers. And his journey would go on to inspire hundreds of millions of fans. But right now, he was just Ash, practicing in his backyard with his future starter—Poliwag?—completely unaware of his own destiny.
"Time to come in!" Stephen's voice cut through the twilight. "Before you both catch colds."
Ash made a token protest, but Poliwag was already waddling toward the house, leaving tiny wet footprints on the stepping stones. I followed, suddenly aware of how my dress clung damply to my skin.
Inside, the kitchen lights cast warm pools across water-spotted floors. Stephen appeared with an armful of towels, tossing one to Ash before holding another out to me. "Did you have fun?"
I nodded, carefully patting my face dry. The towel smelled of sunshine and fresh air—so different from the artificial lavender Dr. Fuji insisted on.
"Ash, shower time," Stephen said, collecting the wet towels. "And don't forget to dry Poliwag properly this time."
"But Dad he’s a water—"
"No buts. You know the rules about wet Pokemon in bed."
Ash thundered up the stairs, Poliwag bouncing after him with surprising grace for something shaped like a beach ball with legs. Their footsteps echoed through the ceiling, followed by the familiar sounds of a shower starting up.
I sank into one of the kitchen chairs while Stephen rinsed my curry plate. Everything about this kitchen spoke of a life well-lived—worn wooden table, mismatched dishes in the drying rack, a calendar covered in Ash's messy handwriting tracking Poliwag's training progress. The kind of collected history Dr. Fuji's hastily set up apartment tried to manufacture.
Stephen dried his hands on a dishtowel, then absently adjusted the chain around his neck. Silence stretched between us, punctuated by Ash's muffled singing from upstairs and the soft clink of Delia putting away her garden tools outside.
"So," he said finally. His voice carried the careful tone of someone who'd spent years helping raise a child, knowing when to push and when to wait. "Do you... remember anything? About before?"
‘What a loaded question.’
Above us, Ash was belting out what sounded like the Pokemon theme song, completely off-key and completely happy. Through the window, Delia's shadow moved across the garden one last time, checking her work.
"Delia had told me some things," Stephen continued carefully when I didn't answer. "About how Amber died, her previous daughter died. About how Dr. Fuji became... obsessed." He leaned against the counter, arms crossed, eyes studying the worn linoleum. "I never thought he'd actually come back. Not like this… not with a… you." His gaze flickered to me, then away, as if avoiding the word 'clone' might make the situation less surreal.
I traced a scratch in the kitchen table's surface, following its path through the wood. How could I explain that Dr. Fuji's obsession hadn't ended with bringing back Amber? That every detail of my existence now had to match some perfect memory he carried?
"Is there anything you need?" Stephen asked quietly. "To feel more comfortable here?"
The question caught me off guard. I stared at the scratch on the table, finger frozen, about to turn a corner along its path. 
A couple weeks ago, in my dorm room, I would've just said time—more time to play Pokémon games. But now that I was in one... I wasn't sure what I needed anymore.
"I don't know," I muttered.
Stephen just nodded, as if uncertainty was the most natural response in the world. Above us, Ash's muffled voice had switched from singing to what sounded like a passionate discussion with Poliwag about proper towel usage.
He pushed away from the counter. "You'll stay in the guest room tonight. It's small, but..." He opened a cabinet, a smile warming his voice. "And since Ash isn't here to claim his share—want another cookie?"
I nodded, surprised by how much I wanted that simple comfort after tasting just a bit of it.
He handed the cookie to me, then glanced at my mud-spattered dress with amusement. "You should probably wash up once Ash is done. Don't want to go to bed like a Mudkip, right?" He chuckled at his own joke. "Just... let us know if you need anything, okay?"
I nodded, slowly nibbling on the satisfyingly sweet sweet.

<Chapter title="[Chapter 14] Flowers for Delia" file="story/14.txt">
Morning came with the sound of Pidgey calls and clinking plates downstairs. The guest room was small but cozy, its yellow walls a welcome change from the stark white of Dr. Fuji's apartment.
I found clothes laid out on a chair—borrowed from Ash, a simple t-shirt and shorts. They still carried a faint scent of laundry detergent. 
I nodded, thankful to be finally rid of the dress. I never liked dresses, especially those frilly ones.
Downstairs, the kitchen smelled of coffee and maple syrup. Stephen stood at the stove, flipping pancakes while Ash set the table, occasionally shooting me curious glances. Under the table, Poliwag sat with its bowl of mixed berries—Oran, Pecha, and what looked like Sitrus—alternating between delicately picking at its breakfast and hopefully watching for dropped pancake bits.
"Morning," Stephen said without turning. "Sleep okay?"
I nodded, then realized he couldn't see me. "Yes, thank you."
Stephen turned from the stove, spatula in hand, and slid the first perfectly golden pancake onto a plate. He placed it in front of me with a warm smile.
"Hey!" Ash protested immediately. "How come she gets the first one?"
Stephen raised an eyebrow. "We have a guest, Ash."
"But—" Ash started, then caught his father's look and slumped in his chair. "Fine," he muttered, shooting me a quick, suspicious glance.
"Yours is coming right up, bud," Stephen said, pouring more batter into the pan, "And this one's bigger."
This seemed to mollify Ash, though he continued watching me from the corner of his eye as if I might somehow steal his breakfast too. 
Stephen set a bottle of maple syrup down in front of me. "Dig in. They're best when they're hot."
Ash tracked the bottle's movement with the intensity of a Fearow watching prey, his eyes narrowing as I picked it up.
I drizzled a modest amount over my pancake at first—the responsible adult portion my brain suggested was appropriate. 
But something about the warm, golden scent rising from the plate stirred a craving I couldn't ignore. Before I knew it, I was tipping the bottle again, watching amber liquid pool in the divots of the pancake.
"Whoa, you like syrup even more than me!" Ash exclaimed, his jealousy momentarily overcome by wide-eyed admiration.
I blinked at my creation—a sugar swamp that my college-self would have dismissed as disgusting. 
But when I took that first bite, the sweetness hit my taste buds like a revelation. My adult mind registered it as overwhelmingly saccharine, but my body responded with pure delight.
"Good, right?" Stephen asked with a knowing smile.
I nodded, already cutting another syrup-soaked piece. Apparently, this body came with its own super sweet tooth.
Stephen slid a stack of three perfectly golden pancakes onto Ash's plate. "Here you go, champ."
Ash immediately grabbed the syrup bottle, tilting it with wild abandon. The sweet liquid splashed and pooled haphazardly, some hitting the pancakes, some creating sticky puddles on the plate, and a few drops landing on the table. From below, Poliwag's excited "Poli!" suggested at least a few drops had made it to the floor.
"Whoa, easy there," Stephen said, reaching for the bottle. "That's way too—"
"But she used even more!" Ash protested, jerking his chin toward me while maintaining his death grip on the syrup.
Stephen's hand froze mid-reach. His eyes darted to my syrup-flooded plate, then back to Ash's half-drowned stack.
I shrunk a little in my chair, taking a hesitant bite as Stephen's gaze wandered to my plate. The sweetness now seemed somehow incriminating.
"Well, I..." he began, scratching the back of his head, then sighed in defeat. "Fair point."
"Just..." Stephen continued, lowering his voice conspiratorially, "don't tell your mother, okay? Either of you."
Ash nodded solemnly, as if they were negotiating state secrets rather than breakfast condiments. Then he dug in with gusto, syrup dripping from his fork with each enthusiastic bite.
We finished our pancakes in companionable silence, interrupted only by Ash's occasional appreciative "Mmm!" and the clinking of forks against plates. As Stephen collected our empty dishes, he glanced at the clock on the wall.
"Almost time for school, Ash. Go grab your backpack—we leave in five minutes."
"Okay!" Ash bolted up the stairs with thundering footsteps that seemed excessive for someone so small. Poliwag waddled after him with the same excitement.
Stephen laughed as he watched his son rush up the stairs, but there was something thoughtful in his expression as he looked at me. His hand went to the worn Pokeball at his neck. "Before we leave..."
The chain clinked softly as Stephen lifted the worn Pokeball from his neck. "This is the girl we discussed last night," he said quietly.
When Electabuzz materialized, the kitchen felt suddenly smaller. Battle scars crossed its yellow fur like a map of old conflicts, the deepest running from shoulder to chest. Small sparks danced between its antennae as it sized me up.
"Buzz, buzz," Electabuzz sighed, crossing its arms with weary patience. The gesture pulled at the old scar running across its chest, a pale line visible even through the yellow fur.
"Come on, just for today," Stephen coaxed. "I said I’ll make it up to you tomorrow. Maybe see if Professor Oak will let us borrow Dragonite for a proper spar?"
Electabuzz's antennae crackled with sudden interest. The resigned slump of its shoulders straightened, competitive fire flickering in its eyes.
"There's that fighting spirit," Stephen grinned. 
Then, turning to me: "Electabuzz here, he’ll keep an eye on things until Delia gets back. And anything happens…" Stephen started.
“If Dr. Fuji shows up?” I supplied quietly.
Stephen glanced at Electabuzz. The electric-type bumped his fists together, sparks dancing between them.
"Buzz Electabuzz!" Electabuzz gave a loud battle cry.
Stephen's grip tightened on the chair. "Yeah. That. Electabuzz wouldn't let him near you." He paused, studying my face. "Unless you wanted to stay—"
I shook my head. "No, not with Dr. Fuji."
The words came easily. That crazy scientist kinda gave me a bad feeling. But it stirred memories of another friend that was still with Dr. Fuji. I wonder if it saw me as a friend.
Stephen nodded silently, looking me over with concern.
"I'll be fine," I said, glancing at Electabuzz with a smile. "We can bond—" Electabuzz snorted at the word, and I dropped a quiet "probably."
Stephen chuckled, ruffling my hair with casual affection that felt both foreign and comforting. "Don't take it personally. Buzz here isn't exactly the nurturing type.”
Electabuzz grunted in confirmation, crossing muscled arms over his scarred chest.
Thundering footsteps answered as Ash careened down the stairs, backpack bouncing wildly against his shoulders while Poliwag trailed after him. He skidded to a stop at the bottom, eyes widening at the sight of Electabuzz.
"Whoa! Dad, is Buzz staying home today?" His disappointment morphed instantly to excitement. "Can I stay too? Please? I want to train—"
"School, Ash," Stephen said firmly, guiding him toward the door.
Ash dug his heels in suddenly, turning to look at me with narrowed eyes. "Wait! What about her?"
Stephen's hand froze on Ash's shoulder as he paused before slowly continuing, “She just arrived. She’ll go to school like you once she settles in.”
Ash's face darkened as he shot me a resentful glare, "Not fair," he grumbled, shoulders slumping as he allowed himself to be guided toward the door.
"There's leftover curry in the fridge for lunch! Just ask Electabuzz if you can't reach it!" Stephen said, then paused to return Poliwag to its ball. 
“Buzz,” Electabuzz snorted, shaking his head with a slight smirk.
I watched through the window as father and son raced down the path, their laughter carrying on the morning breeze. Just another ordinary morning in Pallet Town.
Except nothing about this felt ordinary for me.
I turned to find Electabuzz watching me, arms crossed, sparks casually dancing between his antennae.
Time to figure out how to spend a morning with my new bodyguard. Maybe he’ll be like Ditto?
-[^.^]-
He was not like Ditto.
Where my previous shapeshifting friend had evolved from formal guardian to playful companion, Electabuzz maintained his professional distance.
It scoffed at my attempts to copy his stance, sparks crackling with what might have been annoyance when I mimicked the way he crossed his arms or tried to make funny faces.
I soon gave up and began to explore the house. Electabuzz followed me wherever I went like the diligent bodyguard he was.
Crayon drawings covered the fridge—earlier ones showing wobbly Weedle, Oddish, Rattata, and Butterfree and Caterpie, newer ones proudly featuring a round blue Poliwag. Near the kitchen doorway, pencil marks tracked Ash's height through the years, each line dated in either a neat or messy script.
I wandered upstairs and paused at Ash’s room. Curiosity overcame any sense of boundary—this was THE Ash Ketchum's house, after all.
His room was exactly what you'd expect of a kid: clothes scattered everywhere, half-read Pokemon magazines sprawled open on the floor. I didn't linger long, just enough to spot a well-worn guidebook to Kanto Pokemon buried under some laundry.
The morning dragged on. Between sets of push-ups and squats, I watched some random battle broadcast and studied Stephen's badge case mounted above the fireplace—eight badges gleaming under glass, arranged with pride.
A dual-toned green plant-like emblem, a metallic gray octagonal piece, a gleaming blue water droplet, a red crystalline design, a simple yellow circle, a pink heart shape, a multi-colored flower medallion, and a radiant orange sunburst badge. All 8 of the Kanto badges.
I glanced at Electabuzz, who followed my gaze and snorted. His antennae sparked with what might have been pride... or maybe regret.
Moving closer, I noticed something I'd missed before. Hidden partially behind the badge case was a small, worn black and white photograph
I recognized Electabuzz, though back then the scar across his chest was just unmarked yellow fur. The others... a Graveler with determination in its rocky features, a Pidgeotto still growing into its crest feathers, a proud Growlithe, and a Machop flexing with endearing enthusiasm.
Stephen's words from last night echoed: "I wasn't good enough back then."
I glanced at Electabuzz. He stood motionless, staring at the photo, antennae drooping slightly. For a moment, the stern guardian was gone, replaced by something older and sadder.
Then, my stomach growled loudly, breaking the spell.
Electabuzz shifted, glancing at my stomach with what might have been amusement.
With a businesslike grunt, he gestured toward the kitchen, antennae sparking back to their alert position.
I followed him into the kitchen, where he reached into the refrigerator and pulled the container of curry and rice, reheating it.
Then, he reached back into the fridge to grab a huge container of mixed berries—similar to what Poliwag had for breakfast.
We ate in silence, the only sounds being my spoon against the bowl and the soft crunch as Electabuzz methodically worked through his berries.
After lunch, Electabuzz just tossed the dishes into the sink with a clatter that made me wince, apparently considering his caretaking duties complete for now.
I jumped onto the couch and continued watching the next pokemon battle broadcast. I settled in, trying to follow along with the announcers' rapid-fire commentary about type advantages and counter-strategies, focusing more on the commentary now that my energy had been partially exhausted.
Electabuzz silently stood next to the couch and watched the broadcast with a glint in his eyes—Nostalgia?
The front door slammed open with enough force to make Electabuzz flinch. Ash burst into the living room like a miniature hurricane, backpack half-unzipped and hanging precariously from one shoulder.
"Whoaaa! Is that Clair’s Blastoise?" He vaulted over the back of the couch and landed beside me with a bounce that nearly sent me airborne. "Hydro Cannon is so powerful!"
I blinked, startled by the sudden invasion of my quiet afternoon. Electabuzz made a sound somewhere between a grunt and a sigh.
Delia appeared in the doorway moments later, her expression shifting from mild exasperation at her son to a careful as her gaze passed me. She lingered at the threshold, one hand resting on the doorframe.
"The way Blastoise times those water pulses is genius!" Ash continued, not noticing my surprise or his mother's hesitation. He mimicked a cannon-firing motion with his arms. "See how he waits until the very last second? Dad says that's advanced timing."
On screen, the Blastoise executed a perfect counter-blast, sending its opponent skidding across the arena. The crowd roared.
"Yeah, it's—" I started, but Delia cleared her throat.
"Ash," she said, her voice firm but not harsh. "You can watch the match later. Homework first."
"But Mo-om," Ash dragged out the word. "It’s Clair's Blastoise!"
"Homework," Delia repeated, finally stepping fully into the room. Her eyes flicked briefly to me, then away. “There will probably be reruns later.”
Ash slumped dramatically against the couch cushions. "Fine," he grumbled, but made no move to get up. "Who’s your favorite trainer?" he asked me, lowering his voice as if Delia might not hear him from six feet away.
"Ash." Just his name this time, but with a warning tone that made him sigh loudly.
"Okay, okay." He hauled himself up, dragging his backpack behind him. At the foot of the stairs, he turned back. "Can I watch now and then do homework after dinner? Pleeeease? It’s a Blastoise!"
Delia's expression softened as she glanced at the TV, then at her son—carefully keeping me at the edge of her vision. "Maybe you could try to do your homework during the commercials."
Ash's face lit up. "Really? Yes!" He bounded back to the couch, nearly tripping over his own backpack in his rush. "Did you see that counter just now? The way Blastoise—" He paused mid-gesture, suddenly self-conscious. "Um, do you like Pokemon battles?"
"Do I like Pokemon battles?" The question caught me off guard. After all, my only real experience was through games and—
"Like Pokemon battles?" I grinned, settling more comfortably on the couch. "Of course I do! My entire life I’ve—”
"Right?" Ash's face lit up even more. "Did you see that Hydro Cannon earlier?"
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ROUND THREE AFTER THESE MESSAGES FROM OUR SPONSORS!"
"Oh! Commercial!" Ash scrambled to grab his worksheet, nearly dropping it in his enthusiasm.
"Fifteen times seven..." Ash muttered, scribbling confidently. A very wrong '3' appeared on the page.
"That's not—" Delia and I started at the same time. We both stopped.
I glanced up to find her standing in the doorway. She met my eyes for a brief moment, then nodded slightly and stepped back. "Go ahead," she said softly.
"Okay, let's try this step by step," I said, turning toward Ash. "First rule—always start with the ones..."
We worked through the multiplication problems between bursts of battle and commercials. Ash's pencil would freeze mid-calculation every time a pokemon appeared on screen.
"So seven times five is—"
"OH WATCH THIS!" Ash pointed frantically at the TV. "See how Blastoise's cannons are angled? That means—"
"Rapid Spin!" the trainer—Clair?—shouted as Blastoise tucked itself into its shell and whirled into motion. The massive turtle Pokemon became a blur of brown and blue, its rotation thundering across the arena as it kicked up clouds of dirt.
"Swift! Break its rotation!" The opposing trainer called. His Skarmory's wings flashed as it launched a barrage of star-shaped energy.
The energy stars scattered in brilliant flashes against Blastoise's spinning shell, but the massive Pokemon plowed through, clearing the scattered spikes from the field in its wake, until Clair held out her pokeball and returned it.
As the dust settled, the camera panned across the battlefield. Skarmory landed with a metallic rustle, both trainers steady as they considered their next moves.
Then, they cut to the announcer. "And Clair returns her Blastoise! What will be her next pokemon? Find out after a quick word from our sponsors."
"15 times 7," I read aloud, looking at his half-completed attempt. The "3" sat alone, abandoned mid-calculation. I drummed my fingers quickly on the page, aware the commercials wouldn't last long. "Okay, the first rule—always start with the ones. 7 times 5 is...?"
"35!" Ash was practically bouncing in his seat, pencil already scribbling in the 5 after the 3 and trying to move onto the next problem.
“Wait!” I called out, my eyes darting to the commercial about some of the latest Silph Co. battle gear, then back to the paper to tap the ‘1’ in ‘15’, “You did the one’s, now what about the ten’s? The one in front of 15?”
“Oh right!” Ash said as he wrote a 7 in front of his ‘35.’
“Slow down. What are we supposed to do with the 3?”
Before Ash could answer, both our heads snapped up to the TV screen just as a Dragonair materialized in a flash of red light, its blue scales gleaming under the arena lights.
Skarmory launched into the air with a metallic screech, unleashing Air Slash after Air Slash. But Dragonair simply waited, dodging and weaving through the air. When Skarmory finally overextended, Dragonair struck—one precise Ice Beam that caught its opponent's wing mid-flap, freezing it solid.
"AND THAT’S ROUND THREE!" The announcer's voice rose over the crowd's cheers as Skarmory collapsed into the ground with swirls in its eyes. "We'll be right back after these messages from our sponsors!"
Ash picked up his pencil again, then glanced at me expectantly.
"You have to be patient," I said, my eyes catching a TV ad that felt just like back home—smiling stock footage while an announcer speed-read terrifying side effects. 
"Like Clair back there. See how she didn't rush? Step by step, that's how battling works. And that's how we should do this homework."
Understanding flashed in Ash's eyes as I pointed to the 3, then above the '1' in '15'. "This should go here. We don't immediately add it to our answer. We 'carry' the 3. And then we add it to the '7'."
Ash nodded slowly, erasing the '3' and putting it above the '1'. He looked back at me.
"Good, now what is 7 + 3?"
"Ten!" Ash answered, practically bouncing in his seat as he wrote down the 0, carried the 1, then checked for approval.
I chuckled as a contest battle promo flashed across the screen. "Now we can just write that 1 down. It's like a battle strategy—you don't throw everything at once. You position your moves carefully," I gestured at the carried numbers, "saving some power for when you need it most."
Ash's eyes lit up as he carried back down the ‘1’ into the final answer. "So carrying numbers is like... storing up energy for a big move?"
"Exactly!" I grinned, caught up in his enthusiasm. "Each step builds up to—"
The TV cut through our moment: "—and with that Ice Beam, Clair has knocked out 2 of Nolan’s pokemon! What will be Nolan’s last!" 
“—Build to the final answer to win the problem!” I say, but Ash was already paying more attention to the real pokemon battle.
His pencil hovered above the next math question as Nolan's final pokeball burst open. A Hitmonchan materialized, already bouncing on its feet in a fighting stance.
We spent the next few hours like that—Ash bouncing between furious scribbling during commercials and complete absorption in the matches. His arithmetic was getting neater though, more methodical. Whether any of this would stick once the TV was off... Well… that was a different equation entirely.
Sometimes I caught glimpses of Delia in the doorway, watching. She'd linger longest when I was correcting Ash's work. When I looked up and tried to give her a smile, she attempted to smile back, but it was obviously strained.
“Dinner’s ready!” Delia called out from the kitchen.
Ash immediately dropped his pencil mid-equation, practically bouncing toward the smell of tomato sauce. I followed more slowly, my new body's stomach growling despite my mind's hesitation.
Dinner was pasta with a rich tomato sauce that made my mouth water—comfort food. Electabuzz continued to eat his berries. But something felt off about the meal.
“Did you finish your homework?” Delia asked as she glanced at the wall clock. 6:53.
"Yeah, I finished my math homework thanks to..." Ash trailed off, realizing he didn't even know my name.
"Amb... Amber," Delia supplied, her voice catching slightly.
Ash nodded seriously, “Thanks to Amber.”
"What about your other homework?" Delia asked.
Ash paused mid-bite and tried to look away, suddenly very interested in his glass of water.
Delia sighed, setting down her barely-touched fork. "After dinner, then. And no TV this time. Your teachers say you’re falling behind…" She then glanced at me, something uncertain flickering across her face before she continued, "Maybe Amber could..."
"Sure, I can help Ash," I said quickly.
"I don't need help from a g—" Ash started to protest, then caught himself, looking between his mother and me. Perhaps remembering how I had helped him so much with his math homework, his shoulders slumped in defeat. "Fine. But can we at least work in the living room?"
"How was school today?" Delia asked, her eyes drifting to the clock again. 7:02. "Did Ms. Martinez like your science project?"
Ash's face darkened. "Gary and his friends kept saying my presentation was stupid.” After a short pause, he continued, "Mom, when's Dad and Poliwag coming back?"
"Soon, honey." Delia's fork clinked against her plate as she set it down. 7:03. "He's probably just..."
I focused on finishing my pasta, trying not to think too deeply into it. My new body was still hungry despite everything.
The wall clock ticked on as Delia glanced at it yet again, lines of worry etched in her face.
"Ms. Martinez said my project on water Pokémon was 'overly simplistic'," Ash grumbled, stabbing a meatball with his fork. "No wonder Gary and his friends laughed at me."
"I'm sure it was a wonderful project, sweetie," Delia said distractedly, eyes flicking to the clock. "Everyone starts somewhere with their Pokémon knowledge."
When we finished, Delia soaked the plates in the sink, her movements quick and distracted. Ash spread his English workbook across the living room floor, grumbling about vocabulary words.
"I need to go check on something," Delia said, grabbing her coat. She paused at the door, looking at Electabuzz. Some silent understanding passed between them. "Keep guard?"
The electric Pokemon nodded, stance shifting subtly to something more alert.
I watched her hurry down the path, knowing exactly where she was going—to look for Stephen. To see if Dr. Fuji had done to him what he'd done to those other failed experiments.
The next hour blurred into vocabulary definitions and reading comprehension. Ash tried bargaining for TV breaks twice, but I held firm—remembering my own struggles with divided attention back in college.
"We'll finish faster if we focus," I said after his second attempt. "Then we can watch as much TV as your mom allows."
By the time we finished, the wall clock read 7:42. Still no sign of Delia or Stephen.
Ash sprawled across the couch, flipping through channels while Electabuzz watched from its position by the window. I tried to focus on the colorful battle highlights, but my eyes kept drifting to the darkness outside.
Suddenly, headlights filtered through the window, casting long shadows across the living room walls. Electabuzz's growl started low, barely audible, but I felt it in my chest. I switched off the TV mid-battle commentary.
"Hey—" Ash started to protest, but then he saw Electabuzz's stance—muscles coiled, electricity crackling between its antennae.
The car engine cut off. Footsteps crunched on gravel, slow and deliberate.
The doorbell chimed once. Nobody moved.
It chimed again, followed by knocking. "Delia?" Dr. Fuji's voice carried through the door, oddly calm. "My love? I brought your favorites. Dahlias... just like our first date."
More knocking, harder now. "Please, darling. Don't you remember? Your favorite flowers, your namesake..."
After a few moments of pause, the footsteps retreated. For a moment, I felt relief.
I started to breathe again—
The night lit up red. The door exploded inward in a burst of flames and splinters, framing Dr. Fuji in the doorway. 
His white suit was immaculate, not a wrinkle or scorch mark. Pink and yellow petals scattered at his feet as a Magmar's flames illuminated his face from below, casting strange shadows across his empty smile.
“Delia?”
</Chapter>

<Chapter title="[Chapter 15] Electabuzz v Magmar" file="story/15.txt">
The smell of burning wood filled the air as Electabuzz positioned itself between us and the doorway, sparks dancing between its antennae. 
Static electricity prickled against my skin like thousands of tiny needles, making the fine hairs on my arms stand at attention. I grabbed Ash's arm and pulled him behind the couch, my heart pounding against my ribs so hard I thought it might crack them.
Magmar's flames cast writhing shadows across the walls as it stepped through the ruined doorframe, the floorboards smoking beneath its feet. The temperature in the room jumped instantly, making it hard to breathe.
"Move aside," Dr. Fuji commanded Electabuzz, his voice eerily calm. "I'm here for my family. Delia and Amber."
Electabuzz's response was a thunderous roar as electricity surged through its body, the sudden discharge making my hair stand on end. The lights throughout the house flickered and died, plunging everything into darkness broken only by Magmar's orange flames and white-blue arcs of electricity coating Electabuzz's fur.
"Flamethrower," Dr. Fuji commanded.
As flames erupted from Magmar’s mouth, Electabuzz unleashed a crackling thunderbolt that cut through the flamethrower. The collision sent sparks flying in all directions as ozone filled the air, dispersing the flames.
Without hesitation, Electabuzz lunged through the gap, attempting to close the distance before Magmar could breathe more fire. Electricity coursed around his fists as he whirled them like a windmill.
Dr. Fuji took a step backward, his eyes cold as frost despite fire pokemon in front of him. "Fire Spin."
Magmar matched its trainer's retreat while unleashing a continuous stream of flames from its beak. The fire twisted and spiraled at its command, coiling into an expanding vortex that filled the cramped living room. Electabuzz found itself trapped as the spinning flames closed in.
The heat behind the couch became unbearable as fire licked up the walls. Smoke was already starting to fill the room. I grabbed Ash's arm, keeping low. We needed to move now, while Electabuzz still had Magmar's attention.
“Is there another way out?” I whispered.
Ash nodded and coughed back, “Kitchen.”
I covered my mouth with my shirt and started to crawl towards the kitchen, “Stay low to avoid the smoke.”
As we moved, I saw movement beyond the thickening flames—Dr. Fuji and Magmar backing toward the yard through what remained of the front door, the wall around it now largely consumed by flames. Magmar's beak remained open, exhaling a continuous stream of flames that fed the burning vortex around Electabuzz.
Electabuzz snarled as it threw random bursts of electricity, trying to locate its opponent through the swirling fire.
"Straight through the front door!" I shouted through coughs before I could stop myself. "They're moving outside!"
Electabuzz paused for a fraction of a second as his head—a blurry shadow within the flame vortex—snapped toward me.
Dr. Fuji's face darkened as he heard my voice. Magmar snapped its beak shut and both trainer and Pokemon quickly shifted to the side.
A massive burst of electricity erupted from Electabuzz's form, filling the air with crackling energy that lit up the night. The widespread discharge caught Magmar's side, sending sparks cascading across its body as it staggered but maintained its footing.
Flames and ozone choked the air as the Fire Spin began to collapse, the yard now a sea of ash beneath Magmar's feet. Electabuzz burst through the remaining embers and the ruined doorframe, lunging at the Magmar. It whirled its arms while wild arcs of electricity crackled around his fists.
Dr. Fuji stepped back to the battle's edge, one hand slipping into his pocket. His voice cut through the chaos, cold and clear. "Guard with Fire Punch."
Magmar's fists ignited as Electabuzz charged in, arms whirling faster and faster. Electricity snapped between the electric type’s spinning limbs, growing, building. The very air crackled with charge.
“Smokescreen!” Dr. Fuji called as smoke already began to rise from Magmar’s body, where it suddenly burst into a cloud of dust and smoke.
Before the cloud of smoke, Electabuzz planted his feet, and in a single blinding motion, drove an uppercut. Magmar reared back, the attack just grazing its chin—but the near-miss still unleashed a burst of pent-up electricity. 
Lightning sparked across Magmar's face, drawing a pained hiss.
Dr. Fuji frowned as Magmar staggered, flames sputtering, shaking its head to clear the static. In that heartbeat of distraction, Electabuzz lunged while arcs of barely-restrained power trailed behind whirling fists. Stray bolts earthed themselves harmlessly into the scorched ground with each spinning step.
“Back up and Smog!”
Smog belched from Magmar's beak, quickly smothering the yard in noxious fumes. Electabuzz charged into the haze, whirling arms leaving fading arcs in the smoke.
A blast of flames punched through the smog. Electabuzz dove aside, the searing heat singeing its fur as it rolled to its feet. Spinning fists crackled with power as it lunged again.
Magmar sidestepped, flames sheathing its claws. Fire Punch met Thunder Punch in a blinding flash. Lightning and embers rained across the scorched earth.
Shimmering heat rippled the air around Magmar, obscuring its form as it pressed the attack. Dr. Fuji's voice knifed through the night. "Poison Jab!"
“Buzz Electa!”
Venomous claws dug into Electabuzz’s side, drawing a howl from Electabuzz as toxins seeped into the wound.
In turn, however, static electricity crackled across Magmar's body at the contact, stiffening its muscles.
Electabuzz drove through the poison, fists crackling with electricity as his fist exploded against Magmar's chest in a burst of voltage.
The Fire Pokémon flew backwards, crashing into Dr. Fuji’s rented car. Metal crumpled and hissed as Magmar's searing body melted into the frame.
Electabuzz was already lunging forward, fists crackling as its arms whirled to life once again.
"Now, Fire Blast!" Dr. Fuji shouted.
Magmar’s eyes glinted with a fiery spirit as it opened its maw and a five-pronged inferno blasted Electabuzz at point blank range.
Wreathed in flames, Electabuzz smashed into the house in a rain of flaming debris.
Ash and I ducked for cover into the kitchen as a burning rafter collapsed overhead.
In the sudden stillness, I strained to hear any sound from the battlefield, any indication of Electabuzz's fate. Smoke stung my eyes and caught in my throat. 
“Buzz?” Ash coughed, face pale in the dim light of fire filtering through the haze.
The only sounds were the distant crackling of flames and the shifting of debris settling around us. I hardly dared to breathe, my heart pounding in my ears as I waited for something, anything to break the eerie calm.
Ash clutched at my arm, fingers digging into my skin. I could feel him trembling.
“Electabuzz?”
“Electabuzz!” A roar split the air, raw and primal and full of fury, responding to Ash’s whisper. My head snapped up, hardly daring to hope. I scrambled to my knees, ignoring the broken glass that bit into my palms, and peered out through a gap in the wreckage of the kitchen wall.
There, rising from the rubble like a vengeful spirit, was Electabuzz. Its fur was charred and smoking, angry reddish welts standing out starkly against blackened yellow. But its eyes blazed with determination as it threw its head back and roared again, the sound echoing across the ruined house.
Energy crackled around Electabuzz's body, arcing between its antennae and earthing in the rubble at its feet as it spun its arms once again.
With renewed hope, I pushed myself from the hole and grabbed Ash’s arm toward the kitchen door.
“Flamethrower!” Dr. Fuji desperately shouted as a stream of flames erupted behind us. Then, another shout, “Protocol 3!”
We quickly opened the kitchen back door and ran towards the forest.
I glanced back to catch a glimpse of a wild flash of whitish-blue and yellow colliding with red and purple, propelling anime-like shockwaves at the place of impact, sending me and Ash tumbling, my head hitting the ground.
For a moment I lay there dazed, my vision blurred and head throbbing from the impact. Flashes of color still danced in my peripheral vision. Slowly, I pushed myself up to my hands and knees, my balance unsteady. The world seemed to tilt precariously as I struggled to my feet.
An ominous rumble built in intensity, leaves shaking free from the nearby trees. The very earth suddenly lurched violently.
I glanced back to see something massive and purple step forward, pushing its feet into the earth as the earth groaned and shifted, knocking us off balance once again.
I rolled onto my back and squeezed my eyes shut to clear the fog from my brain, took a few wheezy breaths, before pushing myself back up to see the result of the battle.
I stared, my mind reeling, trying to comprehend the devastation before me. The once neat lawn was now a patchwork of scorch marks and upturned earth. 
And there, in the middle of it all, sat Dr. Fuji. He was in a crater of his own making, his white suit now more brown than white, covered in dirt and grime. He looked smaller somehow, diminished, like a puppet whose strings had been cut.
Several paces away, Magmar stood heaving, wisps of smoke still curling from its beak-like mouth. I could feel the heat radiating off it even from here.
‘Is this really Pokemon?’
“Electabuzz!” Ash cried as he started to rush straight on the battlefield—toward the collapsed electric type, crushed between two layers of dirt, fainted with swirls in its eyes.
“No! Wait!” I shouted and lunged forward, tackling Ash to the ground.
"Get—Get off me!" Ash shouted as he attempted to push me off him.
Dr. Fuji looked down at his once-pristine suit, now caked with dirt and ash. The bouquet of flowers he'd brought—variously colored dahlias—laid crushed and scattered around him, petals torn and stems broken.
"The night’s ruined!" he screamed, slamming what remained of the bouquet into the ground. His shoulders heaved with each ragged breath as he stared at the destroyed flowers.
Then, slowly, the wild fury in his eyes cooled as he glanced toward Electabuzz, still pinned between layers of displaced earth.
"It's all your fault," he said, his voice dropping to a loud whisper that somehow carried across the ruined yard. "If you'd just moved aside..."
He stood, brushing futilely at the stains on his suit before looking briefly at Ditto below him. A contemptuous snort escaped him.
"Magmar." His voice was eerily calm now as he pointed toward the Electabuzz. "Finish it."
The Fire Pokémon nodded, flames flickering brighter as it lumbered toward the helpless Electabuzz. Each step left smoking footprints in the grass.
"No! Don’t! That’s Dad’s partner!" Ash's scream was raw with desperation as he thrashed in my arms, trying to break free. "Electabuzz! Get up! Please! Dad said you'd be his Champion Pokémon! Get up!"
I held him tighter, my own heart pounding as Magmar drew closer to its target. Ash's tears soaked into my shirt as he collapsed against me, his struggles weakening into sobs.
I couldn't look away as Magmar loomed over the fallen Electabuzz. The Fire Pokémon's eyes gleamed with an eagerness that made my stomach turn as it raised a flaming claw high into the air.
Electabuzz, his eyes no longer swirling, met Magmar’s gaze with defiance. A weak spark crawled across its body—one last desperate attempt to summon electricity that wouldn't come. Its muscles tensed, trying to move, to fight, to protect—but the earth held it fast.
The flames burst without mercy or hesitation. Magmar drove its burning claw down, pressing it against Electabuzz's chest. The fire spread hungrily across the Electric Pokémon's fur, a terrible crackling sound filling the air as flesh and fur surrendered to flame. 
The horrific sight burned itself into my memory—Magmar's vindictive expression illuminated by its own flames, the way Electabuzz's defiant gaze gradually dimmed, the terrible silence broken only by the roar of fire and Ash's muffled sobs against my shoulder.
I turned away, unable to watch any longer. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Ditto turn away as well, its amorphous body trembling slightly—whether from exhaustion or revulsion, I couldn't tell.
When Magmar finally stepped back, all that remained was a blackened shape that had once been Ash's dad’s pokemon.
"And you," Dr. Fuji finally turned towards me, voice filled with malice. 
He paused, took a deep breath, and his expression softened into something that might have been mistaken for fatherly concern if we hadn't just watched what he'd done.
"Why did you warn it, Amber? Let it know our position?" His voice now carried that same unnaturally calm tone, but a muscle twitched rhythmically at his jaw. "A good daughter doesn't interfere with her father's..." Dr. Fuji's voice trailed off, his eyes momentarily unfocused as if he'd lost track of reality itself.
Debris crunched under his feet as he picked his way through the ruined yard. "I've tried so hard to give you everything again. The same dresses. The same toys. The same love." His voice cracked on the word 'love,' revealing the fractures in his composure. "But you keep... resisting. Fighting against who you are."
"After everything I've done to bring you back?" he asked softly, his eyes finding mine through the gloom. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a single crushed dahlia petal, rubbing it between his fingers. "We can still be a family."
His gaze refocused onto me… no, to Ash, collapsed against me in quiet sobs as I held him protectively in my arms. A cold smile touched Dr. Fuji's lips. "Once I've fully removed this... temporary arrangement Delia created to fill the void I left behind, we'll be a proper family again. The way we were always meant to be. Just one more step…"
The tiny hairs on my arms stood straight up. Time seemed to slow as I looked down at the boy in my arms—Ash Ketchum, the hero of countless anime episodes I'd watched in my previous life. The would-be Pokemon Master. The kid who was supposed to meet Pikachu, travel across regions, make lifelong friends.
Now he was just a terrified child who'd watched his father's Pokemon burned alive.
"No," I whispered, the word escaping before I could stop it.
Dr. Fuji's face darkened instantly. "What?"
I kept my eyes fixed on Ash's trembling form, avoiding Dr. Fuji's gaze. My mind raced, searching desperately for something—anything—to say that might calm him down, that might get us out of this alive. Maybe if I pretended to cooperate? If I went with him, would he leave Ash alone?
But as I looked at the charred remains of Electabuzz, I knew the truth. There was no reasoning with this man. No scenario where this ended well. And even if I cooperated, would I want to live under a crazed murderer like that?
A strange calm washed over me. I'd already died once, after all. Hit by a truck while chasing a digital Mewtwo. What was one more death?
This world—this hell where Pokemon weren't cute, approachable creatures but deadly weapons in the hands of monsters like Dr. Fuji—wasn't the world I'd dreamed of.
The world I'd escaped to whenever my parents hovered over my shoulder, demanding another hour of studying, another perfect test score. 
"Those games are for boys," they'd say, confiscating my Pokemon cartridges while shoving me into any random supplementary classes they could find.
But I'd always found ways to sneak back to that colorful world where children were heroes and monsters were friends.
Maybe this was my punishment. A twisted afterlife designed to torment me for every rebellious moment, for every hour I spent playing games instead of studying, for failing to be the perfect daughter they wanted. The universe's cruel joke: trapping me in a nightmarish version of the very world that had once been my sanctuary.
I lifted my gaze to meet Dr. Fuji's, no longer trying to hide my disgust.
"I'm not your daughter," I said, my voice stronger than I expected. "I never was."
"What are you talking about?" he asked, his voice tightening as he took a step closer. Confusion flickered across his face.
"Delia was right," I continued, pulling Ash tighter against me. "I’m not Amber. Your ‘experiment’ was a failure."
I paused, letting the words sink in before I added with a chuckle, “You’re a failure. A failure of a scientist, a husband, a father.”
His face contorted with rage, but I kept going, the words spilling out now.
"When you tried to clone Amber, you somehow pulled me into her body instead—a twenty-year-old woman from another world entirely. I died, and then I woke up in your lab." I gave a bitter laugh. "I've been wearing her dresses, living in her house, pretending to be your daughter. But I'm not her. I never was. I never will be.”
I met his eyes directly and chuckled maniacally, "All this time, you've been dressing a complete stranger in your dead daughter's clothes. Think about how fucked up that is. You've been obsessing over some random woman you pulled from who knows where, forcing me into this... this sick fantasy of yours."
"You're confused," he said, but uncertainty flickered in his eyes. "The cloning process—"
A deafening boom thundered behind Dr. Fuji, cutting through whatever his next words were going to be.
He snapped around, his entire body pivoting sharply toward the sound—and in that split second while his back was turned, a massive orange shape smashed into the ground in front of me and Ash, an old man in a white lab coat clutching the orange shape’s neck.
