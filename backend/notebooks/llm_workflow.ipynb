    "\n",
    "All WikiGen agents now inherit from `BaseAgent`, providing:\n",
    "- **Default Models**: Each agent has configurable default provider/model\n",
    "- **Override Flexibility**: Can override provider/model per call when needed  \n",

    "- **Clean API**: Simplified method signatures with optional parameters\n",

      "  \"growth_assessment\": \"This story has immense potential for growth, easily scaling 2-5x its current length. The narrative can expand to cover the protagonist's entire journey through the Pokemon world, from challenging Gym Leaders to confronting legendary Pokemon and Team Rocket's larger operations. The established world-building elements—cloning, genetic manipulation, Team Rocket's infrastructure, and the integration of Pokemon into society—provide a rich foundation for numerous subplots and overarching story arcs. Future content could include exploration of other regions, encounters with iconic Pokemon characters, deeper dives into the lore of Pokemon creation, and the development of the protagonist's unique skills and relationships. The current arc structure is designed to be flexible enough to absorb a wide range of future developments without requiring immediate re-division.\",\n",
      "  \"arc_strategy\": \"The arc division strategy prioritizes the core principle of fewer, more comprehensive arcs to accommodate significant future growth. With only 8 chapters provided, the focus is on identifying the most pivotal narrative transitions. The story begins with a fundamental reset of the protagonist's existence and ends with a significant reveal about her origins and the overarching antagonists. Arc 1, \\\"Rebirth and Revelation\\\" (Chapters 1-6), covers the initial phase of the protagonist's awakening in the Pokemon world, her adaptation, early training, and the crucial exposition that reveals her true nature as a clone and the major players like Team Rocket and Mewtwo. This arc establishes the core premise and conflict. Arc 2, \\\"Celadon's Underbelly\\\" (Chapters 7-8), begins the next phase, focusing on immediate local challenges and investigations within Celadon City that hint at larger conspiracies. This arc is designed to be broad enough to encompass future plot developments related to Team Rocket's activities in the city and the protagonist's growing involvement in uncovering secrets. This conservative approach ensures that future content can be integrated seamlessly without necessitating further arc splitting at this early stage, adhering to the \\\"default to fewer arcs\\\" guideline.\",\n",
