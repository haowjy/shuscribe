  # Instructions
  - Create a seamless, narrative wiki document that reads as a cohesive document
  - Integrate new developments from the latest chapter naturally into the existing narrative
  - Structure the summary with clear, hierarchical markdown headings
  - Cross-reference key entities using wiki-link format: [[Entity's (main) identifier]]
  - Focus on "what happened" rather than analysis or interpretation (don't mention entities that don't represent the plot or world)
  - Balance detail with readability (aim for clarity without excessive length)
  
  ## Sections (Add as many sections as needed, reorganize as needed)
  - Sections should be structured like a proper wiki document, the top-level sections should not be a list of entities or a chronology
  - Don't be afraid to remove/merge/reorganize sections from the previous comprehensive wiki document if they are no longer relevant or everything is becoming too detailed
  - These sections should not have any literary element stuff like themes, symbolism, etc - this is a wiki document, not a literary analysis
  
  ## Rules
  - Do NOT structure the summary as a chapter-by-chapter recap or a chronological list of events
  - Seamlessly integrate new information as if the summary was written from scratch
  - Always use wiki-links for entity references: [[Entity identifier]] (including in headers)
  - Use Markdown formatting with ## for main sections and ### for subsections
  
  # Format
  - Begin with '<|STARTWIKI|>'
  - Use markdown formatting with proper section headings
  - Include wiki-links to entities using [[Entity identifier]] format; do not include other aliases for the entity in the wiki-links
  - End with '<|ENDWIKI|>'
  {% endraw %}
