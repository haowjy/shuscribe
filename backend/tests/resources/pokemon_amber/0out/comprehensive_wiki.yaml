I'll focus on these major sections:\n\n- Overview/Introduction\n- Characters\n- Settings\n- Plot Summary\n- Key Events\n\nLet me now create the updated wiki document.</ANTHROPIC_THINKING><|STARTWIKI|>\n\n# Pokemon: Ambertwo\n\n## Introduction\n\nPokemon: Ambertwo is a story following a Pokemon fan who is unexpectedly reincarnated into the Pokemon world as [[Amber (Reincarnated)]], the daughter of scientist [[Dr. Fuji]]. After a fatal accident in the real world, the protagonist awakens in the body of Amber clone within [[Dr. Fuji's Lab]], just as the genetically engineered [[Mewtwo]] makes its dramatic escape. The narrative explores the protagonist's journey as she navigates her new existence in this familiar yet dangerous world, blending elements from various Pokemon media.\n\n## Characters\n\n### Main Characters\n\n#### [[Amber (Reincarnated)]]\n\nThe protagonist of the story, formerly a dedicated Pokemon Go player from the real world who died in the [[Truck-kun Incident]]. She awakens in the body of Dr. Fuji's deceased daughter, Amber, retaining all memories from her previous life. Initially disoriented by her new smaller body and higher-pitched voice, she quickly grasps the dangerous situation around her. Despite her confusion, she exhibits concern for Dr. Fuji's well-being during their escape from the lab.\n\n#### [[Dr. Fuji]]\n\nA middle-aged scientist responsible for creating Mewtwo and apparently successfully cloning his deceased daughter, Amber. He shows immense emotional attachment to Amber, wrapping her in his lab coat and protecting her from falling debris despite sustaining injuries himself. Dr. Fuji expresses that \"everything will be different now\" and they can \"fix it all—our family, our life,\" suggesting deep personal motivations behind his scientific work.\n\n### Other Characters\n\n#### [[Mewtwo]]\n\nA powerful Psychic-type Pokémon created through genetic engineering in [[Dr. Fuji's Lab]]. Its appearance is described as raw, primal, and terrifyingly real, with violet energy trails hanging in the air behind its movements. Upon awakening, Mewtwo makes brief eye contact with Amber, possibly showing some form of recognition before being attacked by a security guard's Arcanine. Despite its immense power, Mewtwo chooses to escape through the ceiling rather than engage in prolonged combat.\n\n## Settings\n\n### [[Dr. Fuji's Lab]]\n\nA sophisticated underground laboratory dedicated to genetic engineering and cloning experiments. The lab contains multiple tanks filled with amber fluid (one of which housed Amber), advanced equipment including evolution acceleration chambers and containment fields, and appears to be the birthplace of Mewtwo. The lab is located beneath what appears to be a wealthy estate or mansion, with clinical white walls and exposed machinery transitioning to wood paneling and ornate light fixtures in other areas.\n\n### [[Chaotic Laboratory Environment (Pokemon: Ambertwo)]]\n\nFollowing Mewtwo's escape, the laboratory devolves into chaos with emergency lights cutting through steam clouds, sparks raining from destroyed equipment, and alarms wailing in competing frequencies. The destruction includes shattered glass tanks, broken concrete, and spreading fires. During the chaos, a partially-formed Kadabra variant is seen glitching in and out of existence, leaving trails of psychic energy in the air, suggesting other experiments were underway in the facility.\n\n## Plot\n\n### Origin and Reincarnation\n\nThe story begins with the protagonist playing a difficult Pokemon game on their phone, specifically navigating the Pokemon Mansion with a team that includes a Gyarados, Charizard, Kadabra, Dugtrio, Nidoking, and a newly caught Growlithe. When the protagonist receives notifications about a Shadow Mewtwo raid at a nearby location, they decide to pause their game and rush to participate. While crossing a street, the protagonist is struck by a truck in the [[Truck-kun Incident]], with their final thoughts being about their Gyarados left waiting in the paused game.\n\n### Awakening and Escape\n\nConsciousness returns as the protagonist finds themselves floating in an amber-filled tank in [[Dr. Fuji's Lab]]. When the container shatters, they are caught by Dr. Fuji, who joyfully proclaims \"Amber, you're alive.\" The protagonist quickly realizes they are now inhabiting the body of Dr. Fuji's deceased daughter, while simultaneously witnessing the awakening and escape of [[Mewtwo]].\n\nAs Mewtwo wreaks havoc throughout the facility, Dr. Fuji carries Amber through the chaotic laboratory, protecting her from falling debris at the cost of his own safety. They navigate through the damaged lab, passing panicked scientists, security guards, and various Pokemon. Throughout their escape, they witness the true extent of Dr. Fuji's experiments, including glimpses of other tanks and a partially-formed Kadabra variant glitching in and out of existence.\n\nThe chapter concludes with Dr. Fuji and Amber making their way through the burning facility, with Dr. Fuji expressing that everything will be different now and that they can fix their family and life, hinting at his deeper motivations and setting the stage for their future together in this new reality.\n\n## Key Events\n\n### [[Truck-kun Incident]]\n\nThe catalyst event where the protagonist, while rushing to a Shadow Mewtwo raid in Pokemon Go, is struck by a truck and killed in the real world. This accident leads to their consciousness being transferred into the body of Amber in the Pokemon world, setting the primary narrative in motion.\n\n### Mewtwo's Escape\n\nA pivotal moment where Mewtwo awakens and breaks free from containment, creating massive destruction throughout [[Dr. Fuji's Lab]]. During its escape, Mewtwo makes brief eye contact with Amber, suggesting a possible connection or recognition, before blasting through the ceiling and disappearing into the night after a brief confrontation with a security guard's Arcanine.\n\n<|ENDWIKI|>",
