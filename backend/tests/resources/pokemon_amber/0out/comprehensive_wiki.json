## Overview

This story follows a protagonist, an avid Pokémon player from another world, who is reincarnated into the [[Pokemon World (Ambertwo)]] as [[Amber (Protagonist)]], a clone apparently created by [[Dr. Fuji]]. Awakening during [[Mewtwo]]'s destructive escape from the [[New Island Laboratory]], she must navigate the immediate dangers and the implications of her new existence.

## Death and Reincarnation

### The Gamer's Last Stand

In her previous life, the protagonist was deeply engrossed in a Pokémon emulator game on her phone, featuring perma-death rules. During a critical battle in the Pokémon Mansion where her Gyarados faced a Vulpix, she risked losing significant progress. Simultaneously, a Discord notification alerted her to a limited-time Shadow Mewtwo raid in Pokémon GO happening nearby at her university campus library.

Choosing the raid over her emulator battle, she saved her game state and rushed towards the library. Distracted by her phone and the urgency of the raid timer, she ignored traffic signals while crossing a street. She was struck and killed by a vehicle, her last thought being about her Gyarados left paused in the emulator.

### Rebirth in Amber

The protagonist's consciousness returned within a containment tank filled with viscous, amber-colored fluid located in the [[New Island Laboratory]]. She experienced muffled sounds, distorted vision, and the sensation of being suspended in a small, unfamiliar body that didn't seem to need air. The tank eventually fractured and shattered amidst tremors and a powerful, psychic roar.

## [[Mewtwo]]'s Escape and the Awakening of [[Amber (Protagonist)]]

### Encounter with [[Dr. Fuji]]

As the tank broke, the protagonist was caught by [[Dr. Fuji]], who was overcome with emotion, calling her "Amber" and expressing joy that she was alive. He wrapped her small form in his lab coat, which carried scents of antiseptic, coffee, and earth. The protagonist attempted to speak, realizing her voice was now that of a young girl. Seeing [[Dr. Fuji]]'s tears and hearing him call her Amber, combined with the surrounding chaos, led her to understand she inhabited the cloned body of [[Dr. Fuji]]'s deceased daughter.

### [[Mewtwo]]'s Rampage

Amidst the destruction, the protagonist saw [[Mewtwo]], terrifyingly real and immensely powerful, breaking free from its own containment. A brief moment of eye contact between [[Amber (Protagonist)]] and [[Mewtwo]] occurred, filling her with primal fear before it was broken by a security guard's Arcanine attacking [[Mewtwo]] with flames. Recognizing the catastrophic situation depicted in Pokémon lore surrounding [[Mewtwo]]'s creation, [[Amber (Protagonist)]] urged [[Dr. Fuji]] to flee.

## Escape from [[New Island Laboratory]]

### Navigating the Chaos

[[Dr. Fuji]], despite his emotional state, scooped up [[Amber (Protagonist)]] and began navigating the collapsing laboratory. The facility was filled with sparking equipment, shattered tanks, and steam. They witnessed other experimental Pokémon variants glitching in and out of reality. [[Mewtwo]], after being hit by the Arcanine again, blasted a hole through the ceiling to escape. [[Dr. Fuji]] shielded [[Amber (Protagonist)]] with his own body from the falling debris, sustaining injuries including cuts and bruises across his back.

### The Mansion Above

Emerging from the destroyed laboratory level, they entered corridors resembling a wealthy estate, suggesting the lab was hidden beneath or within a mansion. Panicked scientists and security personnel filled the hallways. Fragments of overheard conversations mentioned a security breach, containment failures in "Enhancement Lab Three," the overloading of an "evolution acceleration chamber," and referred to [[Amber (Protagonist)]] as "[[Fuji's legendary clone|Fuji's legendary clone]]".

### Uncertain Future

As they escaped the burning facility into the night, [[Dr. Fuji]], though injured, held [[Amber (Protagonist)]] close. He spoke of fixing their family and life, expressing a desperate hope for the future despite the disaster unfolding around them.
