  "accumulated_text": "<ANTHROPIC_THINKING>Let me analyze the latest chapter and integrate its new information into the comprehensive wiki document. The chapter focuses heavily on Dr. Fuji, providing significant new information about his character, his relationship with Amber, his involvement with Team Rocket, and his connection to Giovanni. It also reveals information about his ex-wife Delia and introduces several new characters associated with Team Rocket.\n\nKey new elements to incorporate:\n1. Dr. Fuji's obsession with recreating his past life with Amber and his wife\n2. Dr. Fuji's emotional instability and controlling behavior\n3. The Team Rocket underground facility beneath the Game Corner\n4. Giovanni's character introduction and interest in Mewtwo\n5. The aftermath of Mewtwo's escape\n6. Dr. Fuji's continued connection to his ex-wife Delia\n7. New characters like Gideon, Archer, Dr. Samba, and other Team Rocket scientists\n8. Details about various research projects like Evolution Acceleration and strength augmentation\n\nI'll need to update existing sections about Dr. Fuji, Mewtwo, Team Rocket, and Celadon City, and create new sections for Giovanni and the Game Corner facility. I'll also need to integrate information about Delia and the reveal about Dr. Fuji's obsession with his past family life.</ANTHROPIC_THINKING><|STARTWIKI|>\n\n## The World and Setting\n\n### The Pokémon World\n\nThe Pokémon world is a reality where humans coexist with creatures called Pokémon.
