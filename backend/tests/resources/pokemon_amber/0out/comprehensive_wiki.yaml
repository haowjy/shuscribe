  "accumulated_text": "<ANTHROPIC_THINKING>Alright, so I'm receiving information about a Pokemon fanfiction/isekai story called \"Pokemon: Ambertwo.\" The task is to update a comprehensive wiki document by integrating new information from the latest chapter. The latest chapter describes how the protagonist, Alexa, dies in the real world and is reborn/reincarnated as Amber, who appears to be Dr. Fuji's daughter (or a clone of her) in the Pokemon world.\n\nLooking at the entities provided, I need to create a cohesive narrative wiki that incorporates all this information seamlessly. The key entities include:\n\n1. Mewtwo (the Legendary Pokémon)\n2. Dr. Fuji (the Scientist)\n3. Amber (the Protagonist)\n4. Dr. Fuji's Laboratory\n5. Shadow Mewtwo Raid Event\n6. Identity Crisis (Pokemon: Ambertwo)\n7. Laboratory Chaos (Pokemon: Ambertwo)\n8. Pokémon Game (Pokemon: Ambertwo)\n\nI'll need to create a structured wiki document with clear sections that incorporates all this information naturally, without making it feel like a chapter-by-chapter recap.</ANTHROPIC_THINKING><|STARTWIKI|>\n\n# Pokemon: Ambertwo\n\n## Overview\n*Pokemon: Ambertwo* follows the journey of [[Amber (the Protagonist)]], a Pokemon fan who dies in the real world and is reincarnated in the Pokemon world as a young girl. After awakening in [[Dr. Fuji (the Scientist)]]'s laboratory during [[Mewtwo (the Legendary Pokémon)]]'s violent escape, she must navigate this new reality while grappling with her altered identity and the dangers surrounding her.\n\n## Characters\n\n### [[Amber (the Protagonist)]]\nOriginally a college student named Alexa in the real world, she is reincarnated in the Pokemon world after being hit by a truck while rushing to participate in a [[Shadow Mewtwo Raid Event]]. She awakens in [[Dr. Fuji's Laboratory]] in the body of a young girl named Amber, who appears to be the successful clone of Dr. Fuji's deceased daughter. Despite her physical transformation, she retains her memories and knowledge of Pokemon from her previous life. Her new body feels foreign to her, from its small size to its high-pitched voice, creating a profound sense of displacement.\n\n### [[Dr. Fuji (the Scientist)]]\nA middle-aged scientist who has successfully created what he believes to be a clone of his deceased daughter, Amber. He displays extreme emotional attachment to the protagonist, prioritizing her safety above all else during the chaos of [[Mewtwo (the Legendary Pokémon)]]'s escape. His lab coat carries scents of antiseptic, coffee, and something earthy, suggesting long hours spent in his underground laboratory. Despite being injured by falling debris during Mewtwo's escape, he remains focused on protecting Amber, expressing belief that \"everything will be different now\" and that he can \"fix it all—our family, our life.\"\n\n### [[Mewtwo (the Legendary Pokémon)]]\nA powerful Psychic-type Pokemon created through genetic engineering in [[Dr. Fuji's Laboratory]]. Unlike its portrayal in games, this Mewtwo appears as something \"raw and primal and terrifyingly real,\" with power that \"hadn't quite settled into being.\" Its escape from the laboratory causes extensive destruction and chaos. During its escape, it briefly makes eye contact with [[Amber (the Protagonist)]], displaying what might be recognition or memory, before being attacked by a security guard's Arcanine and ultimately blasting through the ceiling to freedom.\n\n## Locations\n\n### [[Dr. Fuji's Laboratory]]\nAn underground facility where [[Dr. Fuji (the Scientist)]] conducts genetic experiments, including the creation of [[Mewtwo (the Legendary Pokémon)]] and the apparent resurrection of his daughter as [[Amber (the Protagonist)]]. The lab features tanks filled with amber fluid used for incubating genetic experiments and advanced technology such as an \"evolution acceleration chamber.\" During Mewtwo's escape, much of the laboratory is destroyed, with shattered tanks, broken equipment, and structural failure. Beyond the laboratory's reinforced doors lies a stark contrast: a refined interior resembling a wealthy estate with wood paneling and ornate fixtures rather than clinical white walls.\n\n## Events\n\n### [[Shadow Mewtwo Raid Event]]\nA Pokemon GO event that serves as the catalyst for [[Amber (the Protagonist)]]'s journey. While playing a Pokemon game on her phone in her dorm room, Alexa (the protagonist's original identity) receives Discord notifications about a Shadow Mewtwo raid at the library gym with only a ten-minute window to participate. Her decision to abandon her game and rush to the event leads to her fateful encounter with a truck while crossing the street, resulting in her death and subsequent reincarnation in the Pokemon world.\n\n### Mewtwo's Escape\nA catastrophic event that occurs just as [[Amber (the Protagonist)]] awakens in [[Dr. Fuji's Laboratory]]. [[Mewtwo (the Legendary Pokémon)]]'s violent liberation causes widespread destruction, including shattered containment tanks, broken equipment, and structural damage to the facility. Security forces attempt to contain Mewtwo, with an Arcanine attacking it with fire. The legendary Pokemon ultimately blasts through the ceiling, allowing moonlight to pour into the ruined laboratory. In the aftermath, other failed experiments are revealed, including a partially-formed Kadabra variant that \"glitches\" into the lab before disappearing again. The escape triggers fires throughout the facility, forcing Dr. Fuji and Amber to flee.\n\n## The Real World\n\n### Alexa's Life Before Reincarnation\nBefore becoming [[Amber (the Protagonist)]], Alexa was a college student and avid Pokemon player. She was deeply invested in her Pokemon game, which featured perma-death rules that increased the stakes of each battle. Her careful training of Pokemon like Gyarados (evolved from a Magikarp caught on Route 6) and strategic management of her team demonstrated her knowledge and passion for the game. Her campus life included a dorm room where she would play her game, with the sounds of \"distant voices, someone practicing guitar badly, and the occasional burst of laughter\" filtering through her window.\n\n<|ENDWIKI|>",
