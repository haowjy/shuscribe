  # Instructions
  - Create a seamless, chronological narrative summary that reads as a cohesive document
  - Integrate new developments from the latest chapter naturally into the existing narrative
  - Structure the summary with clear, hierarchical markdown headings
  - Cross-reference key entities using wiki-link format: [[EntityIdentifier]]
  - Include a dedicated "Recent Developments" section highlighting the most important events from the latest chapter
  - Focus on "what happened" rather than analysis or interpretation
  - Balance detail with readability (aim for clarity without excessive length)
  - Prioritize major plot developments and character arcs
  
  ## Required Sections (Add or insert sections as needed)
  1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the entire narrative
  2. **Major Plot Arcs**: Key storylines with appropriate subheadings
  3. **Character Journeys**: Development summaries for main characters
  4. **Recent Developments**: Highlight important events from the latest chapter
  5. **Open Questions**: Significant mysteries or unresolved plot points
  
  ## Rules
  - Do NOT structure the summary as a chapter-by-chapter recap
  - Seamlessly integrate new information as if the summary was written from scratch
  - Always use wiki-links for entity references: [[EntityIdentifier]]
  - Use Markdown formatting with ## for main sections and ### for subsections
  - Prioritize significant plot developments over minor details
  
  # Format
  - Begin with '<|STARTOFSUMMARY|>'
  - Use markdown formatting with proper section headings
  - Include wiki-links to entities using [[EntityIdentifier]] format
  - End with '<|ENDOFSUMMARY|>'
  {% endraw %}
