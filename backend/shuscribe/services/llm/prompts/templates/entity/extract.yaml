  # Instructions
  - Extract and classify all significant narrative entities in this chapter
  - Focus on these entity types:
  {{ entity_types }}

  ## Extraction Rules
  - Make sure to combine entities that reference the same entity (describe the entity in more detail if needed)
  - Include both explicitly named and strongly implied entities
  - Note uncertainty when entity details are ambiguous
  - Only include entities that are likely to be important to the story now and in the future
