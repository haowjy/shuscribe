  # Task
  Process a batch of entities for database upsert (update/insert) operations based on new chapter information.

  {% if story_metadata -%}
  # Story Metadata
  {{ story_metadata }}
  {%- endif %}

  {%- if summary_so_far -%}
  # Story So Far
  {{ summary_so_far }}
  {%- endif %}
  
  # Narrative Context
  
  {%- if recent_summaries -%}
  ## Summary of Previous Chapters
  {{ recent_summaries }}
  {% endif %}
  
  ## Current Chapter
  {{ current_chapter }}
  
  {% if chapter_summary -%}
  ## Current Chapter Summary
  {{ chapter_summary }}
  {%- endif %}

  # Entity Batch for Processing
  The following entities have been extracted from the current chapter:
  {{ entity_batch }}
  
  {% if existing_entities -%}
  ## Existing Entity Database
  These entities already exist in the database and may need to be updated:
  {{ existing_entities }}

  {%- endif %}

  # For Reference
  
  ## Entity Types
  {{ entity_types }}

  ## Relationship Types
  {{ relationship_types }}
  
  # Instructions
  Process each entity in the batch to either update existing records or create new ones
  
  ## Entity Processing Guidelines
  
  For each entity in the batch:
  
  1. **Entity Identity**:
     - Check if the entity exists in the database (by identifier or aliases)
     - If updating, include the `old_identifier`; otherwise leave it null
     - You may refine the main identifier if needed for clarity or uniqueness
  
  2. **Entity Description**:
     - Create a detailed markdown bullet-point description that synthesizes all known information
     - Refine the narrative role based on current understanding
     - Select all applicable entity types (can be multiple)
     - Maintain a complete list of all known aliases
     - Be selective about the facts you add -- these facts should be not "events" but rather "attributes" of the entity
  
  3. **Fact Management**:
     - Add new facts revealed in this chapter
     - Classify each fact by type
     - Identify any facts that should be removed due to new contradictions
  
  4. **Relationship Mapping**:
     - Document all relationships with other entities
     - For each relationship, specify:
       - Target entity identifier
       - Relationship description
       - Relationship type
       - Whether it's bidirectional
  
  ## Conflict Resolution Guidelines
  - When new information contradicts existing data, prefer the new information
  - For ambiguous cases, note uncertainty in the description
  - If an entity appears to be a duplicate with slight differences, merge them and use the most specific identifier
  - If entity identity is uncertain but possible, create a relationship with appropriate description noting the uncertainty
