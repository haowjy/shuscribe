       "As [[Mewtwo]] rampages through the lab, [[Dr. Fuji]] carries the [[Protagonist]] to safety. They navigate through the damaged facility, witnessing the aftermath of [[Mewtwo]]'s escape and other failed experiments. They overhear snippets of conversations hinting at a security breach, containment failures, and an overloading evolution acceleration chamber within [[Dr. Fuji's Lab]]. [[Mewtwo]] blasts through the ceiling, and [[Dr. Fuji]] shields the [[Protagonist]] from falling debris. They eventually escape into a more refined area resembling a wealthy estate. Despite being injured, [[Dr. Fuji]] assures the [[Protagonist]] that they can fix their family and life."
