  "accumulated_text": "<|STARTOFSUMMARY|>\n\n## Wandering the Outer Gardens\n\n*   Amber, with Ditto as a scarf, arrives at the \"Celadon Gym Outer Gardens,\" which resemble a public park. `[!WORLD]`\n*   She observes a Pokemon battle between a Doduo and a Bellsprout, noting the Doduo's heads arguing. `[!WORLD]`\n    *   The Doduo wins due to a lucky super effective peck. `[!WORLD]`\n*   Amber watches other battles, including a Pidgey vs. Spearow, a practice match, and a Muk vs. Poliwhirl. `[!WORLD]`\n*   She and Ditto stop for lunch. `[!CHARACTER]`\n    *   Ditto subtly reacts to the battles, tightening during attacks and relaxing during lulls. `[!CHARACTER]`\n\n## An Impromptu Challenge\n\n*   A confident ten-year-old boy, \"Joey the Kid,\" challenges Amber to a battle for 300 pokedollars. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber hesitates due to not having any money on her, but Joey mocks her, triggering her competitive spirit. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   She accepts the challenge, remembering Dr. Fuji's trust in Ditto. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Joey introduces himself and sends out a Rattata. `[!CHARACTER]`\n\n## The Unconventional Battle Begins\n\n*   Joey immediately commands Rattata to Tackle without a countdown, catching Amber off guard. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber commands Ditto to dodge and transform, but Ditto appears confused. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Joey mocks Amber for having a Pokemon that doesn't know how to fight. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber desperately repeats the command, and Ditto finally transforms into a Rattata. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   The audience is shocked by Ditto's transformation. `[!WORLD]`\n*   Amber briefly worries about revealing Ditto's unique abilities and drawing attention to herself, remembering the theory about Ditto being a failed clone of Mew. `[!CHARACTER]` [!FORESHADOW]\n\n## Status Moves in the Real World\n\n*   Amber commands Ditto to use Tail Whip, questioning if status moves work the same in reality as in the games. `[!CHARACTER]`\n    *   Joey's Rattata hesitates after the Tail Whip. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Joey commands Rattata to keep tackling, but Ditto dodges with unexpected grace. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber's confidence grows as she realizes Ditto isn't just copying Rattata's form but also moving with precision. `[!CHARACTER]`\n\n## Victory and Aftermath\n\n*   Joey commands Rattata to use Quick Attack, and Amber tells Ditto to copy it and meet it head-on. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   The collision results in Joey's Rattata being knocked back and Ditto briefly rippling. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Joey's commands become increasingly frantic, and Ditto effortlessly dodges Rattata's wild attacks. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber waits for an opening and commands Ditto to use Quick Attack, defeating Joey's Rattata. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Joey is initially upset but pays Amber the 300 pokedollars. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber feels guilty about winning money from a child but accepts it, as she is also broke. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   She recognizes that Joey is a good kid at heart as she watches him care for his fainted Pokemon. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Ditto returns to Amber's neck, and Amber praises its work. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber notices that some people are still watching them curiously, likely due to Ditto's unusual abilities. `[!CHARACTER]`\n\n<|ENDOFSUMMARY|>",
