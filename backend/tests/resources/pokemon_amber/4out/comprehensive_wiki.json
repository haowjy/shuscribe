I'll need to update sections about Celadon City, add details about the Celadon Gym, and update character information for Amber and Ditto.</ANTHROPIC_THINKING><|STARTWIKI|>\n\n# Pokemon: Ambertwo\n\n## The World\n\n### Reality of the Pokemon World\n\nThe Pokemon World as experienced by [[Amber (Reincarnated)]] differs significantly from the games. The world has a physical reality that includes detailed ecosystems, complex social structures, and Pokemon that behave as actual living creatures rather than game assets. \n\nThe city planning and architecture show thoughtful integration of Pokemon into urban environments. Buildings defy the simple up-down geography of games, featuring complex layouts and unexpected details. Streets are dominated by bicycles rather than cars, with Pokemon integrated into daily civic life.\n\n### Regions and Locations\n\n#### Celadon City\n\n[[Celadon City]] is a vibrant urban environment where Amber currently resides with [[Dr. Fuji]]. The city features:\n\n- A bustling downtown area with buildings of various heights\n- Transit systems with ticket booths staffed by Pokemon (including a Machop and Meowth) alongside humans\n- A functioning Pidgey postal service\n- The Celadon Gym and its extensive gardens\n- Streets dominated by bicycles rather than cars\n\n#### Celadon Gym\n\n[[Celadon Gym]] is a modern glass and steel facility situated behind ancient ginkgo trees, creating a striking visual contrast. The gym features:\n\n- Carefully planned gardens with Oddish-shaped topiaries, iris and wisteria beds\n- A small pond containing Magikarp or Goldeen\n- A tiered pricing structure for various services:\n  - Ace Challenge Fee: ₽100,000\n  - League Challenge Fee: ₽10,000\n  - League Spectator Day Pass: ₽10,000\n  - Gym Challenge Fee: ₽5,000+\n  - Training Facilities Day Pass: ₽4,000\n\nThe gym complex includes a greenhouse with restricted access, which contains various plants including berries and ferns. This greenhouse is home to at least one [[Gloom (Greenhouse)]] and is monitored by gym staff.\n\n#### Cinnabar Island\n\n[[Cinnabar Island]] housed [[Dr. Fuji]]'s laboratory complex, which was partially destroyed during [[Mewtwo]]'s escape. The island appears to have both research facilities and residential areas.\n\n## Key Characters\n\n### Amber\n\n[[Amber (Reincarnated)]] is the protagonist of the story, a former Pokemon fan who was reincarnated into the body of Dr. Fuji's deceased daughter after being hit by a truck while playing Pokemon GO.
