  "accumulated_text": "<|STARTOFSUMMARY|>\n\n## Approaching the Celadon Gym\n\n*   Amber and Ditto approach the Celadon Gym, observing the transition from natural scenery to modern architecture. `[!WORLD]`\n*   She notes the carefully planned gardens with Oddish-shaped topiaries and a pond with Magikarp or Goldeen. `[!WORLD]`\n*   Amber notices an elderly man on a bench who gives her a creepy grin, making her uneasy. `[!FORESHADOW]`\n    *   Ditto tightens around her neck in response. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   She enters the gym, relieved by the modern, climate-controlled environment.\n*   Amber sees the price board and realizes she can't afford any of the gym's services. `[!CHARACTER]`\n\n## Exploring the Outer Gardens\n\n*   Amber retreats from the gym entrance, feeling sympathetic to the nodding irises.\n*   She asks Ditto for get-rich-quick schemes, receiving a shrug. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber wanders through less maintained sections of the garden, eventually spotting a greenhouse. `[!WORLD]`\n*   She struggles to reach the greenhouse door handle, highlighting her body's limitations. `[!CHARACTER]`\n\n## Inside the Greenhouse\n\n*   Amber enters the greenhouse, noting the warm, humid air and the scent of earth and growing things. `[!WORLD]`\n*   She walks along a path between beds of ferns and berries. `[!WORLD]`\n*   A Gloom appears, and Amber freezes, expecting a battle.\n*   Ditto slides off Amber and transforms into a Gloom, surprising her. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   The original Gloom is delighted and interacts with Ditto-Gloom. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber is relieved that no one saw Ditto's transformation. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   The Glooms happily dance together in a beam of sunlight.\n\n## Confrontation with the Gym Trainer\n\n*   A gym trainer named \"Ponytail Patty\" appears, scaring the Gloom into hiding. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Patty questions Amber's presence in the restricted area.\n*   Patty notices that Ditto-Gloom isn't one of their Pokemon.\n*   Ditto's form wavers, revealing its true nature, and Patty is fascinated. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Patty softens her tone and asks where Amber's parents are. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber struggles to explain her situation, realizing she looks like a child who should be supervised. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Patty warns Amber about entering restricted areas and mentions the Pokemon aren't used to visitors. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber apologizes and leaves, feeling foolish. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   She notices the \"RESTRICTED - DO NOT ENTER\" sign, which was too high for her to see initially.\n\n## An Unfortunate Accident\n\n*   While leaving, Amber is knocked over by a clumsy girl named \"Sneezy Suzie\" who is collecting a fallen Oddish.\n*   Suzie apologizes and quickly leaves. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Ditto helps Amber up. `[!CHARACTER]`\n*   Amber decides it's time to go \"home\" to Dr. Fuji's apartment. `[!CHARACTER]`\n\n<|ENDOFSUMMARY|>",
