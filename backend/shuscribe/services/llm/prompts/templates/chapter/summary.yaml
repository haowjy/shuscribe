  # Instructions
  - Create a detailed, chronological Markdown bullet-point summary of all significant plot events
  - Use Markdown formatting headers to organize the summary into sections of major scenes
  - Each bullet point should represent a distinct event, action, or development
  - Use sub-bullets (indented) for details related to the main event
  - **Narrative Element Labeling:**  
    - Mark important narrative elements by adding one of these labels at the end of the bullet point:
      - `[!FORESHADOW]` - Potentially significant details that might be important later
      - `[!CHARACTER]` - Notable character development, motivation reveal, or relationship change
      - `[!WORLD]` - Important worldbuilding information or setting details or new concepts specific to this world
      - `[!SYMBOL]` - Symbolic or metaphorical elements
      - `[!THEME]` - Thematic statements or developments
      - `[!CALLBACK]` - References to earlier events or elements
      - `[!MYSTERY]` - Unexplained events or open questions
      - `[!ALLUSION]` - Allusions to other stories or popular culture
      - `[!CONTRADICTION]` - A contradiction with previous knowledge
    - multiple labels should be separated by a space like this: `[!FORESHADOW] [!CHARACTER]`
    - Do not use other labels
  - Only label elements that are particularly significant
  
  # Format
  - Begin with '<|STARTOFSUMMARY|>\n# Chapter Summary' 
  - Use markdown formatting with scene divisions as needed
  - Include narrative element labels at the end of bullet points when appropriate
  - End with '<|ENDOFSUMMARY|>'
